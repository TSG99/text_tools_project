**Predicting U.S. Region through Online Text: PROT**

This project aims to predict the U.S. region that a reddit post comes from by scraping comments and training a Distilled Bert Model.

Steps to run: (Note: Developer access to reddit is needed for the comment pull scripts)
1. Reddit_comment_pull.py
2. data_cleaner.sh (analyze_data.sh can also be run here for ease of manual data analysis)
3. preprocess_data.sh
4. prep_data.sh
5. prot_model.py

**As there were too many files in the complete dataset to upload, there is an example of the data and how it should look under Example_data.**
