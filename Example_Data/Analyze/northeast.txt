connecticut
middlesex
car
carrier
fire
closes
section
of
i
95
in
westbrook
this
fucking
guy
also
stopped
under
an
overpass
i
drove
by
on
the
southbound
side
of
95
this
morning
and
only
the
two
cars
at
the
very
end
of
the
truck
were
on
fire
did
the
rest
of
the
cars
ignite
i
was
shocked
to
see
that
he
stopped
under
the
overpass
and
wonder
why
he
didn
t
disconnect
the
cab
of
the
truck
to
get
it
away
from
the
fire
we
need
those
pinball
flippers
to
whack
burning
trucks
out
from
under
overpass
but
seriously
what
compels
people
to
do
that
cool
so
he
will
buy
it
back
and
continue
his
bullshit
great
sad
to
see
so
many
in
the
connecticut
subreddit
talking
about
how
actually
it
s
good
to
cater
to
alex
jones
still
amazed
at
twitter
s
claim
that
it
s
accounts
are
non
transferable
as
part
of
an
acquisition
it
would
seem
to
create
a
hole
in
every
corporate
merger
where
the
target
has
a
twitter
account
unless
elon
only
uses
to
target
victims
of
school
shootings
nothing
new
here
texas
makes
everything
worst
for
everyone
well
that
s
texas
for
ya
pretty
state
but
the
people
and
the
politics
suck
are
you
fucking
kidding
me
texas
judge
ofc
fuck
this
man
we
had
a
chance
for
one
good
thing
in
this
hellworld
removed
boooooooooooooooo
naked
corruption
lock
the
judge
up
gonna
get
downvoted
but
this
was
the
right
decision
the
onion
bid
funds
they
will
get
from
selling
assets
of
infowars
as
part
of
the
offer
that
isn
t
actually
a
bid
it
is
a
debt
in
any
other
auction
the
auction
holder
would
require
the
funds
to
be
on
hand
to
execute
the
purchase
it
isn
t
about
liking
or
disliking
someone
it
is
about
executing
the
law
impartially
in
this
instance
it
was
not
because
people
want
the
onion
to
win
but
you
can
t
tip
the
scale
to
get
the
outcome
you
want
they
rigged
the
bid
so
the
onion
could
buy
it
libshits
in
this
reddit
mad
lol
the
onion
said
the
funniest
thing
would
be
for
them
to
buy
infowars
they
were
wrong
this
is
actually
funnier
and
i
m
no
fan
of
alex
jones
amazing
win
for
alex
jones
keep
fighting
champ
start
the
liberal
tears
that
s
the
goal
who
paid
off
this
judge
this
smells
reading
the
article
and
what
the
judge
said
it
seems
like
he
will
most
likely
have
an
auction
again
instead
of
just
being
awarded
to
jones
it
s
about
free
speech
just
like
you
also
have
the
right
to
say
what
ever
dumb
sh
t
u
wana
say
i
think
it
s
especially
interesting
when
we
consider
how
they
utilize
section
230
to
justify
their
arm
s
length
responsibility
for
content
posted
on
the
site
i
don
t
think
musk
fully
appreciates
how
exerting
ownership
in
this
instance
could
be
used
to
unravel
those
protections
they
may
have
been
part
of
mergers
which
is
meaningless
to
twitter
but
now
that
it
s
in
court
where
a
precedent
may
be
set
they
need
to
defend
their
tos
i
love
tennessee
but
will
never
live
there
for
this
reason
also
fuck
leaving
new
england
anyways
lol
your

wow
dude
you
probably
shouldn
t
be
advocating
for
people
s
murder
online
more
like
boo
hoo
and
yet
they
re
tipping
the
scale
to
get
the
outcome
they
want
getting
jones
to
get
it
back
despite
the
families
agreeing
to
the
onion
deal
at
some
point
if
the
families
who
are
benefiting
from
the
deal
agree
to
it
isn
t
the
outcome
they
want
what
matters
and
not
the
outcome
noted
piece
of
shit
alex
jones
wants
the
trustee
testified
that
a

the
sandy

families
removing

against
info
wars
is
in
the
bankruptcy
code
and
isn

dumpster
fire
legacy
platform
any
time
someone
says
something
true
that
goes
against
the
feelings
of
the
degenerate

majority

will
ensue
many
such
cases
dude
don
t
come
out
here
trying
to
be
reasonable
the
mob
wants
blood
the
onion
got
the
permission
of
the

if
there

you
re

what
did
you
say
something
all
i
hear
is
the
sound
of
drooling
if
you
support
alex
jones
you
are
not
only
a
terrible
person
you
are
actively
evil
the
world
would
be
better
off
without
you
and
him
alex
jones
is
a
fucking
moron
that
sells
bullshit
to
other
morons
he
s
no
champ
he
preys
on
dumb
people
buying
stupid
shit
and
believing
the
stupid
shit
he
says
nah
i
still
want
him
to
lose
but
things
still
need
to
be
done
the
right
way
texas
propaganda
this
reeks
of
musk
who
already
stated
an
interest
in
the
case
elon
aww
you
don
t
know
what
free
speech
is
freedom
of
speech
just
means
that
the
government
can
t
arrest
you
for
saying
something
if
does
not
mean
that
you
can
say
whatever
you
want
with
no
consequences
whatsoever
especially
not
when
the
things
that
you
say
lead
to
people
getting
harmed
if
you
shout
fire
in
a
crowded
theater
and
someone
gets
trampled
to
death
as
a
result
you
are
liable
if
you
re
going
to
try
to
invoke
the
constitution
at
least
try
to
understand
it
they
maybe
need
not
to
it
s
not
helping
social
media
companies
to
advertise
that
none
of
those
companies
do
this
all
of
them
can
this
is
personal
for
musk
this
is
one
company
buying
another
out
of
a
bankruptcy
that
is
a
fairly
common
thing
if
twitter
takes
the
position
that
the
infowars
twitter
account
remains
with
the
bankrupt
company
that
is
going
to
get
very
messy
funny
to
see
right
wingers
clutching
pearls
after
decades
of
violent
rhetoric
about
how
the
left
is
an
enemy
who
needs
to
be
exterminated
then
cries
when
someone
suggests
the
world
would
be
better
off
without
alex
jones
in
this
particular
case
why
not
profiting
off
of
the
death
of
children
and
inciting
your
followers
to
send
death
threats
to
the
families
of
the
deceased
isn
t
much
different
now
is
it
trustees
have
a
duty
to
both
parties
to
get
the
most
they
can
from
seized
assets
because
the
revenue
from
selling
the
assets
is
part
of
judgment
there
are
obvious
corruption
issues
if
you
allow
assets
to
be
sold
for
less
then
they
are
worth
simply
because
the
plaintiffs
agreed
to
it
the
families
are
one
of
many
creditors
in
this
bankrupsy
they
are
the
largest
but
they
also
may
not
be
the
first
in
line
to
get
paid
it
needs
to
be
fair
to
all
creditors
the
families
agreed
to
this
tl
dr
there
are
actually
2
lawsuits
here
a
massive
one
in
ct
and
a
smaller
one
in
tx
the
ct
families
agreed
to
take
a
smaller
share
so
the
tx
families
would
get
a
bigger
share
the
onion
offer
was
smaller
upfront
but
included
future
income
from
operating
the
site
this
judge
needs
to
sit
down
and
stfu
it
s
been
proven
time
and
time
again
that
they
don
t
know
what
consent
means
turns
out
that
s
not
how
bankruptcy
works
imagine
you
own
a
house
in
foreclosure
file
bankruptcy
and
the
bank
gives
the
house
to
your
neighbor
you
complain
but
the
bank
gave
the
neighbor
permission
so
what
s
the
problem
that
s
the
argument
you
re
making
and
a
federal
judge
said
otherwise
it
s
literally
what
happened
suing
people
over
freedom
of
speech
stay
mad
sue
me
for
1
billion
i
didn
t
i
typed
it
here
s
a
20
minute
video
on
just
how
wrong
this
is
turns
out
the
lawyer
handling
it
was
100
in
the
clear
per
the
judges
original
order
and
the
onions
smaller
upfront
but
ad
revenue
offer
may
be
even
financially
a
better
deal
for
the
families
than
the
larger
upfront
offer
jones
made

leon
is

a

at
this
point
from
the
sounds
of
it
and
we
thought
oligarchy
was
bad
just
wait
for
the
tech
ceo
feudalism
can
you
elaborate
what
you
are
saying
i
honestly
don
t
know
what
points
you
are
trying
to
make
with
these
sentences
and
what
they
are
referring
to
it
s
not
helping
social
media
companies
to
advertise
that
none
of
those
companies
do
this
all
of
them
can
twitters
position
from
what
i
have
seen
is
that
the
twitter
account
belongs
to
twitter
and
not
owned
by
either
company
first
of
all
is
the
left
a
person
second
of
all
i
m
pretty
sure
you
re
putting
those
words
in
my
mouth
because
i
would
never
advocate
for
murder
that
s
fully
a
you
guys
thing
no
it
is
calling
someone
a
liar
and
suggesting
that
they
be
murdered
are
in
fact
quite
different
night
and
day
actually
and
doesn
t
the
onion
deal
come
with
potential
future
income
which
the
jones
deal
doesn
t
that
s
one
of
the
reasons
it
was
agreed
to
i
think
there
are
obvious
corruption
issues
with
selling
the
assets
and
immediately
giving
them
back
to
the
person
who
used
those
assets
to
harass
these
people
in
the
first
place
and
certainly
obvious
corruption
issues
with
billionaires
using
their
power
to
manipulate
the
situation
to
ensure
people
like
alex
jones
get
to
avoid
consequences
the
trustee
has
the
duty
to
get
the
maximum
value
due
to
the
difference
in
worth
vs
debt
the
onion
bid
in
conjunction
with
sandy
hook
families
reducing
their
debt
decreases
that
difference
more
than
alex
jones
was
able
to
come
up
with
they
are
the
largest
but
they
also
may
not
be
the
first
in
line
to
get
paid
it
needs
to
be
fair
to
all
creditors
the
people
who
are
first
in
line
to
get
paid
in
this
case
are
the
people
who
are
working
on
the
bankruptcy
liquidation
after
they
get
their
costs
and
fees
the
rest
of
the
money
goes
to
the
creditors
the
remaining
money
is
distributed
among
creditors
proportionally
every
creditor
gets
a
percentage
of
that
based
on
what
percentage
of
the
debt
is
owed
to
them
it
needs
to
be
fair
to
all
creditors
the
amount
of
debt
owed
in
this
case
dramatically
eclipses
the
value
of
the
assets
no
one
is
getting
paid
anywhere
close
to
what
is
actually
owed
to
them
and
because
the
plaintiffs
from
the
connecticut
case
own
close
to
97
of
the
debt
the
other
creditors
are
going
to
be
getting
very
little
money
no
matter
what
happens
even
though
the
other
offer
was
a
higher
bid
it
would
have
resulted
in
the
other
creditors
getting
less
money
because
the
offer
that
was
just
rejected
included
the
connecticut
plaintiffs
agreeing
to
accept
a
smaller
percentage
of
what
they
were
owed
this
judge
has
nothing
to
do
with
either
of
those
lawsuits
this
is
a
bankruptcy
case
and
a
bankruptcy
judge
the
winners
of
those
lawsuits
are
some
of
many
creditors
which
may
or
may
not
have
priority
in
addition
the
bid
included
future
income
of
the
site
which
is
impossible
to
determine
since
infowars
has
never
been
marketed
or
promoted
as
a
satirical
website
what
future
income
imagine
you
own
a
house
in
foreclosure
file
bankruptcy
and
the
bank
gives
the
house
to
your
neighbor
you
are
skipping
the
steps
where
a
judge
orders
your
house
liquidated
and
given
to
the
creditors
i
e
the
bank
and
the
bank
agrees
to
sell
it
to
your
neighbors
even
though
you
bid
more
because
your
neighbors
have
better
credit
than
your
morally
bankrupt
ass
that
a
ology
would
only
work
if
your
neighbor
had
a
lien
on
your
property
for
a
value
greater
than
the
house
and
was
taking
the
asset
of
the
house
to
reduce
said
lien
yeah
federal
judges
are
never
corrupt
surrrreeeeee
ok
norm
there
is
a
difference
between
freedom
of
speech
and
just
putting
out
fake
content
for
money
alex
jones
knows
what
he
was
doing
look
at
all
the
snake
oil
he
sales
he
s
just
a
conman
trying
to
rile
people
up
because
it
makes
him
money
this
decision
is
highly
suspect
both
economically
and
morally
bankruptcy
court
judges
have
a
lot
of
leeway
to
bend
decisions
towards
fairness
and
equitable
outcomes
where
the
debts
were
historic
defamation
judgments
from
how
alex
jones
bullshit
encouraged
his
radical
followers
to
terrorize
these
victims
the
victims
co
signed
the
sale
and
improved
the
outcome
for
other
creditors
in
what
world
would
stopping
this
sale
serve
fairness
and
equity
why
doesn
t
alex
jones
fuck
off
and
just
launch
his
next
defamatory
bullshit
platform
think
of
all
the
companies
that
build
their
brands
on
these
platforms
facebook
x
instagram
etc
who
will
be
made
very
uncomfortable
to
see
x
enforcing
this
provision
so
forcefully
it
s
not
good
for
business
for
social
media
companies
and
i
think
they
tend
not
to
do
what
musk
is
doing
in
court
i
wonder
too
if
there
could
be
backlash
as
to
libel
law
if
he
wants
to
own
their
content
so
hard
but
i
don
t
know
leaving
the
question
gray
and
fuzzy
is
sometimes
better
right
now
platforms
are
shielded
from
that
sure
but
politics
aside
do
you
understand
how
messy
this
can
get
like
pepsi
buys
hometown
soda
co
but
then
hometown
soda
co
s
old
owner
says
they
still
own
the
twitter
account
yeah
in
a
greater
sense
twitter
stills
owns
the
account
and
no
one
can
sue
for
damages
if
twitter
suddenly
shuts
down
but
practically
speaking
pepsi
should
be
able
to
buy
hometown
soda
and
reasonably
expect
all
their
goodwill
financial
term
if
you
are
unfamiliar
with
it
to
go
along
with
it
if
musk
wins
this
fight
corporations
are
going
to
face
risks
in
mergers
and
acquisitions
based
simply
off
whether
musk
likes
them
or
not
didn
t
say
you
did
but
you
certainly
hardcore
support
people
that
do
you
re
in
the
connecticut
subreddit
supporting
alex
fucking
jones
so
miss
me
acting
like
you
re
the
moral
authority
by
the
way
notice
how
you
started
by
not
denying
you
think
murdering
the
left
is
good
you
didn
t
say
no
i
don
t
agree
with
that
violent
rhetoric
you
said
the
left
isn
t
a
person
no
but
it
s
made
up
of
people
who
you
support
the
killing
of
by
who
you
vote
for
very
good
now
actually
address
what
i
said
without
trying
to
downplay
it
as
far
as
the
trustee
s
duty
is
concerned
it
doesn
t
matter
where
the
assets
go
just
that
the
judgement
is
paid
there
is
no
history
of
the
site
as
a
satirical
site
like
the
onion
wants
to
do
which
means
there
is
nothing
to
base
future
revenue
on
for
all
we
know
it
could
be
zero
dollars
the
judge
appointed
a
trustee
to
oversee
the
bankruptcy
and
gave
him
broad
latitude
to
conduct
it
the
trustee
was
specifically
given
authority
to
do
what
he
did
but
uhhh
you
do
know
revenue
forecasting
is
a
well
established
process
right
sure
infowars
only
unintentionally
operated
as
satire
but
the
onion
has
been
operating
since
1988
and
they
have
been
successful
in
this
instance
they
are
buying
a
company
with
tens
of
millions
in
revenue
they
can
hire
accredited
financial
analysts
to
forecast
their
profits
it
may
not
pan
out
5
10
years
from
now
but
business
is
inherently
risky
watch
the
video
i
linked
above
which
lays
it
out
clearly
theonion
would
run
infowars
as
a
satire
site
they
already
signed
a
deal
with
michael
bloombergs
everytown
for
gun
safety
for
advertising
and
would
have
been
able
to
sign
other
advertisers

the

hook
families
acquires
infowars
and
announces
everytown
for
gun
safety
as
exclusive
advertiser
for
launch
along
with
multi
year
agreement
launching
a
website
is
financially
a
risk
sure
but
potentially
it
could
have
made
the
onions
1
75m
ad
revenue
an
even
better
deal
than
jones
3
5m
offer
the
families
chose
to
take
that
risk
this
judge
is
out
of
line
off
add
revenue
on
the
site
i
believe
you
can
t
just
let
creditors
accept
lower
offers
on
estate
assets
if
they
do
that
then
why
not
just
accept
an
offer
from
themselves
for
a
dollar
the
trustee
is
obligated
to
maximize
the
return
of
the
estate
which
is
in
the
best
interest
of
the
creditors
that
s
why
we
appointed
bankruptcy
trustees
instead
of
letting
creditors
just
carve
up
debtors
themselves
no
dude
the
point
of
bankruptcy
is
to
protect
individuals
from
the
whims
of
their
creditors
there
are
processes
in
place
for
how
items
within
a
bankruptcy
estate
can
be
sold
to
satisfy
outstanding
debts
and
the
reason
we
have
those
processes
is
because
we
are
a
civilized
country
with
morals
and
laws
instead
of
an
angry
mob
my
real
estate
brokerage
is
frequently
hired
to
liquidate
properties
in
bankruptcy
and
i
assure
you
that
the
rules
are
there
for
good
reason
retribution
without
process
is
not
justice
it
s
vengeance
this
wouldn
t
leave
the
question
gray
and
fuzzy
especially
with
how
profile
it
is
this
case
would
set
precedent
for
the
future
they
would
still
be

e

addresses
revenue
from
peddling
conspiracy
theories
and
jones
being
a
big
part
of
why
it
had
that
revenue
it
s
like
saying
i
m
buying
a
tennis
racket
company
making
tens
of
millions
of
dollars
stop
making
tennis
rackets
and
now
make
canoe
paddles
the
money
made
off
tennis
rackets
is
moot
and
it
s
moving
to
a
completely
different
market
kept
the
name
though
the
families
are
not
after
the
money
they
are
after
the
removal
of
infowars
and
alex
jones
after
the
15
minutes
of
memes
is
up
the
organization
they
bought
would
basically
bring
in
nothing
in
revenue
the
trustee
was
given
latitude
by
the
judge
in
this
face
the
families
decided
the
lower
upfront
offer
with
the
possibility
of
ad
revenue
was
a
better
offer
than
the
higher
upfront
bid
again
your
analogy
doesn
t
make
sense
when
the
sandy
hook
families
debtors
would
be
considered
the
bank
well
that
was
the
question
230
but
the
first
objection
is
more
sure
i
think
sometimes
you
don
t
want
to
set
precedent
aggressively
asserting
ownership
is
bad
for
business
in
this
case
agreed
but
this
is
bankruptcy
where
the
trustee
can
enforce
those
terms
as
they
are
effectively
handling
the
agreement
to
purchase
so
twitters
ultimate
ownership
is
a
moot
point
the

a
35

all
they

have
to
do
is

it

we
need
to
organize
as
a
populace
to
put
an
end
to
these
junk
fees
if
we
can
t
elect
a
government
that
will
do
something
about
it
perhaps
class
action
law
suit
will
get
their
attention
since
public
benefits
is
a
donation
can
we
claim
them
when
filing
taxes
we
the
citizens
need
to
organize
to
defeat
the
obvious
corruption
that
allows
eversource
to
rob
the
people
of
connecticut
public
benefits
is
a
tax
they
won
t
call
it
that
but
it
s
a
tax
how
big
is
your
house
is
your
heat
electric
oil
or
gas
your
bill
is
almost
double
ours
if
you
haven
t
already
get
an
energy
audit
of
your
house
there
are
lots
of
ways
to
reduce
your
energy
usage
we
have
a
house
filled
with
computers
game
consoles
and
tvs
running
all
the
time
and
a
kid
who
keeps
turning
on
the
ac
in
his
room
and
we
don
t
pay
anywhere
near
that
i
also
work
from
home
with
nonprofits
hi
so
someone
is
basically
always
here
if
you
have
electric
heat
this
makes
a
bit
more
sense
we
probably
pay
100
150
per
month
for
our
oil
so
that
would
match
things
up
pretty
well
check
out
budget
billing
on
the
eversource
site
it
lets
you
pay
the
same
amount
every
month
so
you
don
t
get
surprised
by
bills
it
is
always
the
same
they
recalculate
it
annually
definitely
helps
the
budget
i
got
my
bill
down
to
163
this
month
with
rationing
the
already
rationed
light
and
appliances
usage
next
resort
is
candles
next
ceo
on
the
list
you
should
change
your
supplier
for
a
little
bit
of
relief
so
strange
to
me
that
eversource
can
split
out
public
benefits
so
everyone
gets
mad
at
poor
people
and
the
government
but
they
get
to
sneak
their
usually
10
14
profit
margin
on
a
public
utility
into
another
category
solar
was
the
best
decision
we
ever
made
i
don
t
even
know
what
the
fuck
is
going
on
with
my
bill
i
have
forced
air
heating
with
a
giant
tank
of
oil
but
my
electric
bill
was
400
this
month
what
is
consuming
that
much
electricity
are
those
systems
that
power
hungry
i
can
t
understand
why
the
bills
looks
so
different
mine
is
40
supply
and
100
delivery
for
451
kwh
supply
08995
kwh
we
should
not
be
paying
transmission
delivery
and
public
benefit
based
on
kilowatt
hour
using
more
electricity
doesn
t
use
more
wire
or
pols
i
think
there
should
be
a
state
wide
boycott
where
no
one
uses
power
for
an
entire
day
pathetic
i
know
makes
my
stomach
turn
we
need
to
be
super
rich
or
super
poor
us
middle

get
a
beating
why
are
customers
paying
for
public

removed
is
there
any
way
you
can
go

honestly
we
did
and
it
s
the
best
move
we
ever
made
no

bent
over

you
could
have
saved
30
by
switching
to
standard
service
eversource
supply
you
are
getting
screwed
by
your
3rd
party
supplier
i
mean
you
also
blew
over
30
by
not
selecting
the
lowest
rate
supplier
this
bill
i
will
say
it
s
not
ideal
but
i
d
seriously
look
into
the
budget
billing
system
they
have
it
locks
in
your
rate
for
the
whole
year
based
on
your
average
usage
so
no
matter
how
much
or
how
little
you
use
your
monthly
bill
will
be
the
same
then
when
you
re
up
your
budget
billing
the
following
year
they
ll
adjust
your
rate
based
on
that
year
and
give
you
a
credit
for
anything
you
paid
in
excess
last
year
my
bill
was
always
270
for
the
whole
year
i
was
in
it
i
used
a
lot
of
electricity
in
2
months
due
to
fans
to
dry
out
my
flooded
basement
then
this
year
after
the
adjustment
i
pay
241
for
this
year
going
forward
if
nothing
else
it
s
great
for
not
having
to
worry
about
crazy
spikes
up
and
down
and
as
a
single
mom
you
d
more
than
likely
qualify
i

all
this

yes
i

your
eversource
bill
dollar
amount
without
showing
usage
is
cowardice
or
ignorance
oh
man
and
we
went
like
a
couple
days
without
a
redundant
eversource
post
and
i
believe
our
governor
lamont
is
on
the
take
by
eversource
he
is
on
their
payroll
why
wouldn
t
he
come
to
defense
of
the
people
of
connecticut
when
this
is
out
of
control
there
s
nothing
you
can
do
just
try
to
relax
and
it
will
feel
better
for
you
public
benefits
is
contingent
upon
use
your
usage
is
the
largest
factor
driving
your
costs
so
maybe
and
here
s
a
thought
be
more
mindful
of
your
usage
some
of
us
have
reasonable
bills
i
believe
governor
lamont
is
on
the
eversource
payroll
what
other
reason
is
there
to
explain
how
he
does
not
come
to
the
defense
of
the
citizens
when
the
situation
is
out
of
control
in
another
place
they
said
they
had
locked
in
at
11
8c

doing
some
math
that
is
about
1115
kilowatt

the
public

charge
portion
of
the

27
of
your
bill
on
this
invoice
represents
many
unexplained
categories
such
as
1
energy
assistance
programs
to
keep
bills
lower
for
folks
qualified
at

below
poverty
income
levels
2
investments
in
clean
energy
ct
rate
payers
are
funding
the
purchase
of
millstone
nuclear
site
est
costs
the
private
group
buying
and
reopening
this
facility
is
1
5
billion
even
though
the
amount
agreed
upon
by
lamont
s
designated
representative
to
overlook
this
deal
was
originally
800
million
buckle
up
folks
because
rate
payers
are
shouldering
this
purchase
my
numbers
here
may
not
be
100
accurate
i
am
posting

from
my

of
reading
about
this
a

the

i
looked

there
s
no
such

as
public

anyway
they
don

forgive
anyone
s

give
away
a

kwh
to
the

for

they
just
defer

collection

not

the

off
everyone
always

the

thing
is
blowing
my
mind
why
the
hell
do
they
need
to
borrow
anything
never
mind
the
over
3
billion
being
reported
for
the
upcoming
fiscal
year
they
bleed
us
dry
yet
still
need
to
borrow
and
yet
still
cannot

their

i
am
baffled
that
we
continue
to
allow
this
nonsense
bring
back
trust
busting
it
s
not
a
donation
it
s
a
pass
through
tax
from
the
state
since
public

is
a
donation
can
we
claim
them
when
filing
taxes
mandatory
charges
for
public
benefits
programs
are
generally
not
tax
deductible
if
it
explicitly
says
its
optional
and
not
mandatory
or
that
it
s
labeled
as
a
donation
on
the
bill
we
can
deduct
it
else
we
cannot
we
need
to
open
our
own
coop
and
build
solar
farms
with

could
be

to

a

going

eversource
says
it
has
been
underpaid
for

one
reason
is
because
of

why
are
customers
paying
for
public

my
december
bill
just
came
in
and
my
public
benefits
was
171
just
a
little
higher
than
local
delivery
which
was
165
of
the
total
bill
it
s
taxes
in
a
different
name
to
make
you
hate
eversource
more
that
s
to
pay
the
bills
of
non

and
those
on

aide
but
this
is
where
the
actually
comes
from
you
can
literally
google
public

electric

isn

that
fraud
lol
are
you
not
scared
of
any
legal
repercussions
that
can
come
i
hope
you
get
caught
and
fined
100x
what
your
avoided
payments
were
worth
dude
there
are
people
who
need
that
support
and
you
are
just
mooching
off
that
by
lying
no
better
than
going
to
a
food
pantry
for
free
handouts
when
you
can
afford
the
groceries
yourself
on
a

complaining
about
public

charges
which
is
exactly
what
kind
of

you
are

advantage

you

your

this
is
why
people
with

don

care
as
much
about
these
high
eversource

as
renters
many
of
us
don
t
have
this

get

outrageous

my
last

was
11
dm
me
if
you
want
my
guys
details
where
in
the
state
are
you
because
for
most
of
this
latitude
and
specifically
in
this
state
solar
is
definitely
not
the
best
option
unless
your
home
is
planted
in

of
an

and
you

40

i
did
the
math
would
need
52

and
i
don

have
anywhere
near

needed

you

ouch
electric

your
energy
use
rates
look
high
all

but
there
s
a
definite
peak
in

i
m
on

and
my
worst
month
was
summer
electric
cars
multiple
home
servers
what
are
you
doing
that
you
re
using
so
much
electricity
even
if
you
switch
i
don
t
think
you
avoid
all
the
fees
do
you
its
for
your
benefit
rate
hikes
have
been
under
democrat
leadership
in
the
capitol
building
what
s
his
name
oh
lamont
oh
and
what
s
other
dumbasses
name
oh
yea
malloy
before
you
blame
lamont
are
you
sure
your
state
legislators
aren
t
some
of
the
ones
making
laws
for
our
state
who
literally
work
for
eversource
it
a
hostage
situation
you
can
t
have
electric
company
without
electricity
buying
customers
and
yet
the
same
customers
are
expected
to
pay
said
charges
based
their
electricity
usage
next
time
you
go
to
supermarket
and
they
tell
you
if
you
buy
more
than
half
gallon
of
milk
you
have
to
pay
double
the
price
how
would
you
feel
pathetic
take
regardless
of
your
usage
you
are
fine
with
67
of
your
bill
going
to
bullshit
charges
yeah
just
shut
your
heat
off
and
freeze
i
like
it
good
plan
bozo
they
already
said
it
s
from
electric
heat
are
you
blissfully
unaware
that
there
are
literally
eversource
vice
presidents
who
were
voted
by
people
of
connecticut
into
the
state
house
so
while
you
are
saying
the
governor
must
be
in
their
pocket
there
literally
are
state
reps
who
are
vps
at
eversource
wouldnt
suprise
me
honestly
i
figured
they
were
done
after
like
12
or
so
years
ago
when
they
screwed
everyone
over
for
a
solid
few
weeks
after
that
storm
but
nope
theyre
still
here
could
it
be
that
they
have
electric
heating
or
ev
or
both
if
that
s
true
then
op
needs
to
take
a
hard
look
at
their
usage
less
electricity
usage
is
good
for
your
pocket
book
and
good
for
the
environment
ct
rate
payers
are
funding
the
purchase
of
millstone
nuclear
site
est
costs
the
private
group
buying
and
reopening
this
facility
what
are
you
talking
about
i
don
t
love
the
public
benefits
charge
but
it
isn
t
a
flat
charge
it
is
based
on
kwh
usage
so
if
you
use
less
electricity
then
that
portion
of
your
bill
also
goes
down
so
the
question
still
remains
how
many
kwh
did
op
use
my
wife
and
i
use
250
300
kwh
month
and
our
bill
is
100
so
looks
like
op
uses
a
lot
of
electricity
honestly
it
should
be
illegal
in
connecticut
it
is
so
much
more
expensive
than
any
other
form
of
heat
i
m
just
curious
how
many
kwh
they
used
and
is
it
due
to
a
ev
or
electric
heat
hot
water
i
ve
never
had
a
bill
this
high
average
is
80
ac
for
2
weeks
24
7
and
it
was
120
i
switched
back
to
constellation
in
aug
at
0
0859
rates
always
changing
people
care
too
much
about
a
credit
score
and
keep
paying
for
things
they
don
t
agree
with
banks
and
big
business
are
out
of
control
if
everyone
literally
stopped
paying
do
you
think
it
would
get

where
i

some
of

detail
do
you

sq
ft
house
2
100
square
feet
central
heat
no
central
ac
no
electric
heat
solar
led
motion
sensitive
lights
when
entering

room
almost
no

wired
lights
need

be
used
anymore
highest
consumption
is
my
hot
water
heater
bought
the
replacement
heater
2
years
ago
with
an
800
cash
rebate
from
eversource
it
still
sits
in
the
box
in
the
basement
but
i
can
t
get
anyone
to
install
it
and
my
home
office
homelab
which
runs
24x7
350w
500w
continuous
i
just
replaced
the
10
year
old
samsung
washer
and
dryer
pair
with
2024
model
lg
smart
washer
and
dryer
the
dryer
is
an
internal
heat
pump
dryer
no
vent
needed
and
it
s
significantly
more
efficient
than
the
previous
models
700w
at
its
highest
vs
4
500w
for
the
previous
samsung
dryer
for
example
once
i
replace
the
hot
water
heater
i
ll
have
to
diy
it
because
after
calling
47
different
plumbers
hvac
installers
nobody
wants
to
install
it
because
they
didn
t
sell
it
to
me
and
can
t
make
a
profit
on
the
markup
it
will
probably
cut
my
bill
by
another
100
month
i
m
using
the
smart
plugs
now
to
cut
off
the
power
to
the
fridge
between
3am
and
6am
which
saves
me
90kwh
month
i
measured
this
by
putting
govee
temp
sensors
in
the
fridge
and
measuring
how
long
i
could
keep
it
off
doors
closed
before
the
temp
would
rise
enough
to
cause
food
to
come
close
to
a
thawing
point
i
subtracted
an
hour
and
set
the
smart
plugs
to
schedule
that
off
on
time
every
day
i
am
using
sonoff
s31
plugs
flashed
with
tasmota
to
expose
the
prometheus
metrics
endpoint
so
i
could
measure
their
current
draw
and
graph
it
in
real
time
with
grafana
anything
else
you
might
want
to
know
i
can
try
to
explain
in
detail
it
has
a
lot
more
to
do
with
the
millstone
nuclear
site
agreement
they
try
to
paint
it
as
public
assistance
to
make
some
people
more
sympathetic
and
to
make
the
most
of
the
rest
hate
poor
people
this
isn
t
true
at
all
there
is
a
discounted
rate
available
for
certain
income
levels
10
i
think
and
other
programs
where
they
help
lower
your
bill
they
absolutely
provide
public
benefits
for
those
who
get
behind
in
the
winter
but
can
t
be
shutoff
they
have
a
pay
down
program
where
they
reduce
your
amount
by
what
you
pay
a
second
time
so
you
pay
100
they
forgive
100
and
your
bill
goes
down
200
so
now
we
are
paying
double
or
some
never
pay
it
back
or
maybe
they
will
create
a
surplus
to
cover
future
non
payment
when
people
eventually
do
pay
their
bills
still
should
not
be
able
to
tax
the
same
income
twice
the
money
i
m
paying
into
the
public
benefits
charge
should
not
count
towards
my
yearly
earnings
your
bill
says
if
you
used
the
standard
rate
your
bill
would
be
cheaper
that
s
way
too
high
standard
is
even
cheaper
thats
still
a
bit
too
high
see
if
you
can
negotiate
or
at
least
be
checking
energize
ct
regularly
to
see
if
you
can
find
a
better
offer
i
also
have
constellation
but
a
24
month
contract
at
8
59c
kwh
until
july
2026
there
was
also
a
100
sign
up
bonus
despite
me
having
had
constellation
in
the
past
it
went
down
in
summer
by
a
lot
tho
you
probably
paid
hundreds
more
than
the
standard
rate
your
kwhr
could
be
1
cent
it
doesn
t
change
the
fact
that
90
of
the
bill
is
surcharges
and
made
up
bs
it
looks
like
you
shared
an
amp
link
these
should
load
faster
but
amp
is
controversial

thank
you
for
the
info
i
thought
customers
might
like
to
know
that
info
as
well
that
is
a
small
part
of
it
the
largest
part
is
due
to
millstone
smart
guy
admits
to
committing
a
crime
to
look
cool
online
it
s
worse
and
i
say
this
as
somebody
with
solar
your
paying
to
make
up
for
what
is
costs
them
to
give
us
net
0
billing
forced
upon
them
by
our
legislators
more
and
more
people
have
it
and
it
pushes
the
system
so
that
the
few
that
don
t
are
heavily
subsidizing
those
with
it
people
don
t
get
that
most
of
the
distribution
side
is
fixed
costs
by
were
divvying
it
up
by
how
much
power
you
use
well
i
on
paper
use
no
power
ca
started
charging
realistic
prices
and
rooftop
solar
is
nearly
dead
what
you
don
t
like
cake
se
of
the
river
i
get
good
sun
damn
52
panels
how
many
kwh
are
you
guys
burning
no
the
actually
energy
cost
is
the
smallest
part
of
the
bill
i
m
not
trying
to
be
serious
but
how
is
that
part
of
an
energy
bill
someone
send
luigi
the
info
on
eversource
j
k
but
seriously
this
is
getting
ridiculous
you
can
t
just
say
that
without
naming
names
holy
crap
that
s
legalized
corruption
are
we
becoming
another
syria
we
are
having
a
discussion
to
say
i
m
blissfully
unaware
is
not
helpful
present
your
facts
without
insulting
people
in
an
unrelated
case
but
with
regard
to
government
corruption
i
went
to
my
local
planning
commission
to
complain
about
a
neighbor
illegally
operating
on
property
zoned
as
wetlands
and
the
planning
commissioner
said
that
the
zoning
regulations
were
open
to
interpretation
lololol
why
are
there
regulations
on
the
books
if
anyone
can
do
what
they
want
you
cant
make
it
up
and
they
allowed
this
guy
to
build
a
house
on
land
zoned
as
wetlands
probably
i
was
just
posting
what
their
usage
was
because
someone
asked
it
is
but
those
who
have
no
other
option
end
up
paying
for
infrastructure
that
you
pay
very
little
for
charging
for
infrastructure
per
kilowatt
hour
is
a
scam
to
pay
other
people
s
share
for
the
usage
of
such
infrastructure
you
using
300
kw
h
or
his
1000
uses
the
same
infrastructure
regardless
the
only
per
kw
h
charge
here
should
be
the
supply
the
rest
should
be
split
equally
per
each
customer

it
is
saving
up
to
replace
it
with
a
heat
pump
or
similar
is
only
made
more
difficult
by
how
damn
expensive
it
is
this
is
why
my
thermostat
is
set
to
58
and
i
walk
around
my
place
in
fleece
pajamas
and
a
hoodie
it
is
so
much
more
expensive
than
any
other
form
of
heat
the
irony
here
is
that
per
energy
put
in
vs
energy
used
electric
heat
is
nearly
100
efficient
oil
and
gas
is
around
80
90
at
best
case
if
your
furnace
is
newer
and
well
maintained
people
care
about
it
because
it
can
significantly
impact
what
you
are
able
to
do
in
modern
day
us
if
it
doesn
t
matter
to
you
by
all
means
do
your
thing
i
m
not
giving
up
my
800
just
because
electricity
is
expensive
yup
that
s
part
of
it
as
well
a
very
useful
part
as
we
would
have
blackouts
without
that
plant
going
we
don
t
have
the
infrastructure
in
place
to
import
power
from
elsewhere
to
replace
that
boondoggle
and
it
s
will
be
10
20
years
until
we
do
if
we
started
today
which
we
haven
t
mind
you
it
s
not
fission
that
s
the
issue
it
s
outdated
design
and
insane
regulatory
framework
that
s
the
issue
i
have
electric
baseboards
heat
in
my
1300
sq
ft
house
and
my
bills
last
year
maxed
out
at
around
360
at
the
worst
are
you
running
the
heat
in
each
room
all
day
i
keep
my
thermostats
at
50
degrees
in
all
rooms
and
only
turn
them
up
when
i
m
in
that
specific
room
maybe
consider
investing
in
a
pellet
stove
or
something
in
the
short
term
to
reduce
costs
if
you
re
unable
to
deal
with
the
cold
the
long
game
for
me
is
a
heat
pump
but
we
re
a
ways
off
from
affording
that
that
seems
nuts
to
me
we
have
about
the
same
house
size
but
the
lower
level
isn
t
fully
finished
it
is
however
stocked
to
the
gills
with
soundboards
speakers
amps
lights
and
instruments
because
that
is
the
rehearsal
space
for
my
husband
s
band
and
my
kid
has
drum
lessons
down
there
i
work
from
home
and
am
running
two
macs
all
day
but
just
laptops
we
have
multiple
game
consoles
and
tvs
going
at
any
given
time
too
we
don
t
use
smart
plugs
we
just
use
energy
efficient
bulbs
we
have
oil
heat
i
can
t
fathom
how
your
bill
is
nearly
3x
our
bill
that
s
nuts
or
last
bill
was
around
230
bingo
the
millstone
deal
is
close
to
80
and
it
was
bipartisan
why
must
you
dig
for
an
angle
to
hate
your
fellow
man
when
the
real
enemy
sends
you
a
letter
each
month
telling
you
they
re
screwing
you
if
you
mean
for
federal
income
tax
yeah
but
then
the
state
would
have
to
live
within
the
fiscal
guardrails
with
this
they
have
a
loophole
around
them
and
can
spend
more
of
our
money
yeah
i
m
pretty
much
paying
for
your
share
of
fixed
costs
you
re
welcome
how
many
kwh
are
you
guys
burning
it
varies
super
efficient
2k
sqft
home
no
electric
heat
no
ac
in
the
summer
averaging
1
100kwh
month
last
month
was
an
outlier
so
we
peaked
at
1
900kwh
highest
month
ever
bill
was
670
normally
the
bill
hovers
between
270
and
470
depending
on
whatever
amount
eversource
decides
to
raise
their
rates
that
month
i
have
6
x
440w
bifacial
panels
deployed
on
a
diy
ground
mount
filling
an
ac200max
b230
battery
system
every
2
3
days
can
t
fill
the
4kw
storage
in
a
single
day
s
worth
of
sun
i
m
limited
by
the
input
capacity
of
the
ac200
1200w
max
input
but
will
be
switching
that
out
to
rack
mounted
eg4
lls
batteries
and
a
different
inverter
soon
it
powers
my
office
when
it
reaches
90
then
switches
back
to
grid
when
it
reaches
20
it
hasn
t
made
a
dent
despite
powering
my
office
8
9
hours
day
3
days
a
week
so
you
would
still
pay
all
the
same
fees
like
i
originally
said
most
of
it
is
a
direct
state
contract
to
buy
energy
from
millstone
to
keep
it
operating
normally
energy
is
bought
on
the
open
market
that
s
the
supply
part
of
the
bill
we
ve
discussed
it
here
in
r
connecticut
many
times
at
one
point
there
were
seven
of
them
at
once
after
every
election
cycle
the
names
change
and
there
are
either
more
or
less
of
them
serving
as
reps
in
the
statehouse
but
they
are
always
in
there
b
c
they
run
for
office
and
they
get
elected
by
ct
people
who
do
not
give
a
fuck
that
eversource
has
employees
in
the
statehouse
a
quick
google
shows
that
here
is
currently
only
1
eversource
lawyer
serving
as
a
ct
state
senator
so
not
as
bad
as
it
used
to
be
it
s
got
a
name
my
friend
regulatory
capture
is
when
a
company
or
a
whole
industry
intentionally
pushes
their
lawyers
or
old
ceos
into
government
to
make
sure
they
never
get
bothered
when
they
do
something
illegal
or
fuck
over
their
employees
etc
lmfaooooo
becoming
this
entire
country
has
been
ruled
by
legalized
corruption
for
as
long
as
it
has
existed
connecticut
has
just
always
been
the
worst
example
of
it
they
said
that
in
direct
response
to
your
accusation
that
the
governor
was
essentially
solely
responsible
for
this
mess
we
are
having
a
discussion
to
say
i
m
blissfully
unaware
is
not
helpful
present
your
facts
without
insulting
people
dude
you
just
seriously
claimed
that
the
governer
is
on
eversource
payroll
i
apologize
to
you
adjective
noun
number
i
hope
you
have
a
good
evening
lmao
thats
such
horseshit
they
just
didnt
wanna
do
their
jobs
weirdly
it
can
be
was
it
zoning
or
wetlands
i
m
in
our
wetlands
commission
there
s
times
we
do
allow
construction
in
the
wetlands
or
flood
zone
but
that
storage
has
to
be
made
up
somewhere
else
to
make
up
for
it
and
neighbors
don
t
have
flooding
so
depending
on
the
size
of
the
property
and
how
much
wetlands
is
impacted
it
s
possible
during
my
tenure
i
saw
a
farmer
who
built
a
road
through
his
site
in
the
flood
zone
without
permission
and
they
made
him
take
it
out
tbh
after
working
with
him
for
months
to
get
it
permitted
most
of
our
wiggle
room
is
things
like
a
place
wants
to
fill
in
potholes
in
an
existing
road
a
corner
of
a
shed
will
be
in
the
wetlands
an
existing
property
wants
to
redevelop
parking
that
kind
of
thing
a
whole
house
seems
wacky
you
misunderstand
infrastructure
you
need
more
parallel
infrastructure
to
distribute
more
power
hence
it
makes
perfect
sense
to
charge
for
infrastructure
based
on
usage
an
analogy
is
cars
on
a
road
more
cars
means
that
one
lane
road
needs
to
become
2
or
3
lanes
now
that
is
more
capital
cost
up
front
and
also
more
maintenance
cost
year
after
year
year
than
a
1
lane
road
would
be
so
makes
sense
to
charge
based
on
who
drives
more
ie
tolls
than
it
does
to
charge
a
flat
rate
to
everyone
in
the
state
no
it
used
to
be
like
that
until
people
lobbied
to
make
it
variable
as
a
way
to
save
money
if
you
use
less
they
wanted
to
be
charged
less
that
doesn
t
show
rate
payers
buying
the
plant
this
is
eversource
guaranteeing
a
price
to
be
paid
for
a
certain
amount
of
electricity
back
in
like
2019
natural
gas
was
super
cheap
and
millstone
said
they
weren
t
going
to
be
able
to
survive
at
those
prices
rather
than
close
the
plant
they
made
a
deal
to
but
power
at
a
certain
cost
it
just
so
happened
natural
gas
then
rose
in
recent
years
so
they
probably
wouldn
t
have
gone
out
of
business
but
the
contract
was
already
signed
the
payments
to
millstone
should
be
done
iirc
in
like
april
of
2025
good
luck
i
was
able
to
afford
a
wood
pellet
stove
after
my
first
winter
with
electric
heat
now
my
total
heating
expense
is
about
2
months
of
what
electric
was
for
that
one
winter
and
that
s
keeping
my
house
at
a
comfortable
temp
instead
of
in
the
high
50s
yes
for
others
who
may
not
know
even
with
higher
efficiency
of
electric
resistance
heaters
of
electric
converted
to
heat
energy
the
electric
usually
costs
much
more
per
btu
dollars
per
heat
energy
compared
to
gas
oil
and
wood
deleted
i
m
with
you
here
with
the
credit
score
but
as
a
collective
change
only
happens
when
we
all
decide
enough
is
enough
know
a
few
linesman
and
it
seems
like
a
lot
of
this
hike
is
from
the
state
saying
they
would
cover
the
costs
of
not
shutting
of
power
during
the
pandemic
which
doesn
t
to
have
happened
i
don
t
have
an
opinion
either
way
more
than
just
eversource
is
to
blame
for
all
of
this
and
it
seems
to
impact
the
middle
class
of
this
state
the
most
ya
pretty
sure
it
s
around
75
there
s
a
bunch
of
little
programs
aimed
at
renewables
and
related
infrastructure
then
the
rest
is
forgiveness
to
people
out
of
work
etc
during
covid
we
had
it
in
the
mid
60s
constantly
for
a
few
select
rooms
we
had
a
newborn
so
we
didn
t
want
to
push
it
really
we
have
a
heat
pump
system
and
pellet
stove
now
and
the
bill
is
more
like
300
in
the
winter
but
we
also
have
a
loan
for
the
mini
splits
so
it
s
like
another
300
a
month
on
top
of
that
still
cheaper
i
can
t
fathom
how
your
bill
is
nearly
3x
our
bill
that
s
nuts
or
last
bill
was
around
230
i
don
t
even
watch
tv
haven
t
turned
the
tv
on
in
the

in
about
8
months
no
gaming

no

that

eversource

only
going

dies

we

looking

down
went

it
s

nice
not

couple
more

either

i

the

basically
using

in

they

lobbyists

sooo
our

thanks

uhh

its

s
your

i
m
in

my

150

tops
out
at

300

what
do
you
mean
a
failing

that
heat
should
still
be
going
into

tank
it
can
t
just
disappear
you
likely
have

coming
into
the
tank
if
you
can
t
find
someone
to
install
it
it
should
be
an
easy
enough
task
for
you
to
do
yourself
since
you
ll
already
have
an
electric
source
near
it
since
you
have
an
older
one
now
at
3000
kwh
a
a
year
for
hot
water
i
d
be
getting
that
fixed
asap
you
re
throwing
money
away
but
like
i
said
you
have
a
leak
somewhere
even
with
the
new
one
you
ll
be
using
more
than
you
d
think
because
that
hot
water
is
going
somewhere
no
ridiculous
over
use
of
anything
in
the
house
i
mean
that
s
where
you
are
wrong
the
vast
majority
of
people
don
t
have
a
homelab
which
sucks
up
12
kwh
a
day
how
much
my
entire
house
family
of
4
uses
on
average
i
work
from
home
your
high
usage
is
completely
on
you
you
need
to
come
to
terms
that
you
will
use
a
lot
of
electricity
homelab
but
you
should
be
looking
to
find
that
hot
water
leak
asap
it
will
be
better
next
spring
when
the
millstone
deal
falls
off
the
public
benefits
charge
i
keep
trying
to
vote
this
guy
out
but
it
hasn
t
worked
yet
no
because
at
least
house
reps
are
voted
in
as
opposed
to
doge
and
potentially
his
cabinet
no
that
s
exactly
how
it
works
more
usage
more
cables
required
more
power
plants
required
more
administrative
overhead
costs
required
do
i
think
electricity
in
ct
is
overpriced
absolutely
do
i
acknowledge
that
charges
associated
with
electricity
should
be
usage
based
not
flat
rates
absolutely
i
m
not
sure
you
re
thinking
about
this
logically
deleted
that
was
an
excellent
article
long
but
well
worth
the
read
eye
opening
i
had
no
idea
that
eversource
was
also
a
tax
collector
a
major
tax
collector
part
of
the
problem
however
is
that
the
administration
has
never
really
said
where
all
the
cxtra
clectricity
would
come
from
and
it
s
not
just
connecticut
several
new
england
states
including
massachusetts
are
all
making
the
leap
to
more
clectricity
increasing
demand
without
thus
far
increasing
supply
and
whatever
supply
they
do
get
they
want
it
to
be
clean
and
renewable
unfortunately
that
comes
at
a
cost
one
borne
by
ratepayers
and
taxpayers
connccticut
ratepayers
have
contributed
more
than
billion
toward
these
government
programs
policies
and
mandates
yeah
seriously
just
quickly
glossed
over
the
whole
oh
yeah
and
a
home
lab
that
s
constantly
using
electricity
24
hours
a
day
indefinitely
hopefully
we
just
need
some
more
activism
and
more
power
plants
are
not
required
based
on
my
usage
as
the
electricity
is
being
purchased
from
the
power
plants
and
that
s
what
the
supply
charge
is
for
that
s
the
only
per
kilowatt
charge
that
makes
sense
let
s
say
you
have
solar
you
use
solar
electricity
during
the
day
at
night
you
use
electricity
from
the
grid
and
you
use
the
same
amount
as
what
i
use
at
night
at
the
end
of
the
month
you
may
pay
close
to
zero
for
infrastructure
and
i
pay
per
kilowatt
why
should
only
i
pay
for
infrastructure
and
you
are
not
get
it
do
you
understand
what
irony
is
thats
what
happened
when
politicians
are
trying
to
avoid
the
balanced
budget
they
don
t
have
money
to
throw
around
in
the
general
budget
so
they
make
somebody
else
do
it
it
leads
to
very
regressive
taxes
the
millstone
deal
three
quarters
of
the
public
benefits
charge
was
set
to
last
for
10
months
which
i
think
is
around
next
april
may
that
s
the
only
per
kilowatt
charge
that
makes
sense
no
that
s
the
only
per
kilowatt
charge
that
you
understand
i
m
done
arguing
with
you
on
this
i
have
years
of
experience
working
in
manufacturing
and
supply
chain
clearly
you
are
an
angry
consumer
who
doesn
t
like
to
see
logic
i
m
not
defending
eversource
they
are
greedy
i
personally
believe
that
energy
should
not
be
privatized
i
like
how
wallingford
does
it
but
i
am
explaining
to
you
why
things
cost
money
and
why
it
makes
sense
to
charge
people
by
usage
not
by
a
flat
rate
what
you
can
control
is
how
much
energy
you
use
use
less
your
bill
goes
down
simple
math
i
wouldn
t
pay
nothing
but
i
would
pay
less
because
i
m
using
less
so
there
needs
to
be
less
infrastructure
to
support
me
than
there
does
for
you
going
back
to
the
car
analogy
should
someone
who
only
commutes
every
other
day
pay
more
less
or
the
same
than
the
person
who
commutes
every
day
if
you
are
using
the
same
amount
of
electricity
at
night
the
infrastructure
needs
are
the
same
for
you
and
me
you
lack
any
logic
maybe
installed
if
i
am
in
fact
using
my
peak
amount
of
electricity
at
the
same
time
that
all
of
the
neighbors
in
my
road
are
at
their
peak
which
is
probably
not
likely
tbh
but
even
if
we
pretend
that
s
the
case
most
of
the
maintenance
for
the
infrastructure
which
is
much
more
expensive
over
the
years
than
the
installed
cost
itself
is
based
on
cumulative
energy
not
strictly
time
so
the
more
total
energy
passing
through
a
transformer
station
every
month
means
that
you
need
to
replace
parts
and
conduct
maintenance
much
more
frequently
than
if
there
is
no
energy
passing
through
have
a
good
night
we
re
done
here
i
can
only
try
to
explain
the
same
thing
so
many
ways
before
i
give
up
and
let
you
stay
angry
wife
and
i
are
relocating
to
connecticut
due
to
my
work
we
went
house
hunting
this
weekend
and
have
narrowed
our
search
to
between
two
homes
1
home
is
in
trumbull
1
home
is
in
milford
are
there
any
key
and
obvious
differences
between
the
two
towns
which
we
should
know
about
is
one
town
inherently
better
suited
for
young
families
than
the
other
about
us
we
are
in
our
mid
30s
no
kids
yet
but
one
on
the
way
we
will
be
on
our
own
as
our
families
are
located
in
the
midwest
our
thought
is
that
we
will
be
in
connecticut
between
3
5
years
potentially
longer
i
m
looking
for
recommendations
on
places
to
live

hi
there
i
live
in
milford
and
love
it
seriously
never
been
happier
if
you
are
looking
for
more
of
a
seaside
town
that
s
close
knit
this
is
it
the
community
here
is
amazing
very
family
oriented
and
plenty
of
fun
events
like
the
oyster
fest
tree
lighting
and
farmer
markets
there
is
the
walnut
beach
area
downtown
milford
with
amazing
food
social
scene
and
gulf
beach
area
the
food
here
is
great
downtown
has
stonebridge
and
sbc

whole
foods
trader
joe
s
costco
and
boston
post
road
mall

movie
theatre
target
barnes
and
noble
you
name
its

i
love
the

of
shopping
in

but
then
driving
10
minutes
and
seeing
a
sunset
at
gulf
beach

love
walking
and
n
downtown

house
after
school
systems
are
great
and
local
daycares
are
great
i
feel
very
safe
here
i
could
not
recommend
milford
more
as
u
tristategirl
mentioned
southington
itself
wh
and
newington
i
would
add
cheshire
and
farmington
southington
itself
is
a
nice
place
newington
and
west
hartford
are
also
nice
wallingford
is
great
been
here
7
years
and
it
has
everything
i
would
avoid
ansonia
and
waterbury
shelton
is
nice
and
has
everything
if
you
need
schools
shelton
is
the
only
one
that
s
acceptable
it
does
i
know
since
i
grew
up
there
shelton
and
milford
are
also
very
nice
and
the
taxes
are
better
i
live
in
shelton
now
fairfield
shouldn
t
be
counted
out
the
side
bordering
black
rock
has
some
reasonably
priced
condos
and
small
homes
monroe
and
newtown
are
nice
but
too
far
from
everything
westport
budget
won
t
go
super
far
but
checks
your
boxes
milford
nice
town
budget
will
get
you
a
nice
house
and
checks
your
boxes
just
a
little
further
from
nyc
than
westport
new
milford
good
option
but
wont
check
the
walkable
option
near
a
lake
not
beach
madison
and
guilford
good
options
but
getting
close
to
that
90
minute
nyc
commute
easy
access
to
new
haven
though
if
you
are
ok
with
taking
a
train
definitely
more
options
but
these
ones
came
to
mind
thank
you
so
much
this
is
such
an
amazing
and
thorough
response
i
greatly
appreciate
the
insight
since
we
are
completely
new
to
connecticut
this
helps
us
with
our
house
hunting
decision
for
your
kid
sandcastle
daycare
little
white
house
and
gingerbread
house
of
milford
are
all
amazing
what
are
the
best
areas
in
new
britain
husband
and
i
are
also
starting
a
family
here
and
can
t
wait
for
our
kids
to
grow
up
here
new
britain
schools
are
horribly
rated
you
would
have
to
hope
your
kid
gets
into
nearby
alternatives
the
area
around
ccsu
and
anywhere
bordering
farmington
or
newington
are
all
safe
your
location
or
work
proximity
would
help
have
you
tried
stop
shop
starbucks
mooyah
haven
hot
chicken
tropical
smoothie
cafe
wings
over
newington
they
re
all
in
the
plaza
near
campus
go
in
person
don
t
just
send
in
an
application
online
keep
following
up
i
highly
recommend
applying
at
the
buildings
at
school
i
did
that
at
uconn
a
few
years
ago
and
luckily
landed
a
job
doing
journalism
for
the
engineering
building
pay
wasn
t
great
but
it
was
a
great
opportunity
that
s
the
thing
with
student
jobs
is
they
can
only
allot
you
a
certain
amount
of
hours
and
pay
i
d
suggest
finding
a
restaurant
or
bar
near
campus
and
applying
there
the
tips
will
help
the
most
with
affording
books
and
school
supplies
i
dont
know
how
your
grades
are
but
if
you
re
doing
well
in
math
in
particular
you
might
want
to
try
being
an
on
campus
tutor
try
costco
i
heard
it
s
a
great
place
to
work
and
they
have
benefits
what
kind
of
work
are
you
looking
for
any
experience
or
skills
do
you
have
access
to
a
car
i
d
definitely
try
to
find
a
job
at
your
school
for
the
coming
semester
it
took
me
a
long
time
to
find
mine
as
well
i
had
to
literally
keep
searching
the
university
job
site
every
other
day
and
after
about
3
months
an
entire
summer
of
checking
constantly
when
i
was
about
to
give
up
and
start
waitressing
i
randomly
saw
an
awesome
10
hour
a
week
coding
job
that
i
was
able
to
do
from
my
couch
it
was
awesome
lol
otherwise
if
you
rly
can
t
wait
i
know
a
lot
of
local
schools
always
need
paraeducators
or
substitute
teachers
or
community
centers
sometimes
need
people
to
lifeguard
and
other
such
stuff
but
i
d
definitely
stick
it
out
with
finding
a
job
as
part
of
your
university
if
you
can
go
to
westfarms
and
stop
at
every
store
in
the
mall
and
inquire
it
s
atleast
50
or
60
of
them
finding
a
job
is
a
job
sometimes
join
your
town
neighboring
town
s
facebook
group
parents
are
always
looking
for
tutors
babysitters
for
their
little
ones
both
long
term
and
short
term
try
ltc
long
term
care
facilities
assisted
living
facilities
hospitals
if
you
can
get
a
job
in
a
union
facility
even
better
there
are
many
entry
level
jobs
in
housekeeping
laundry
kitchen
dietary
aide
union
facilities
usually
start
18
50
iirc
a
background
check
will
be
done
by
the
facility
some
will
also
require
a
physical
drug
test
urinalysis
and
fingerprinting
all
paid
for
by
the
facility
came
back
to
ask
whereabouts
are
you
located
central
new
britain
area
by
uconn
give
us
an
idea
what
location
you
would
like
to
work
in
i
m
not
sure
about
that
area
but
have
you
looked
into
the
emergency
services
public
safety
area
on
campus
call
center
for
911
calls
or
something
similar
ccsu
new
britain
the
smaller
stop
shop
down
the
road
from
the
big
one
by
ccsu
always
has
a
hiring
table
by
their
door
i
ve
tried
starbucks
and
they
always
reject
me
after
the
interview
might
have
been
doing

many

that

they

you
could

took
my
wife
there
to
get
a
custom
wand
made
for
her
bday
a
few
years
ago
and
it
was
a
great
experience
i
used
to
like
harry
potter
until
jk
rowling
became
a
deranged
bigot
out
of
nowhere
seriously
ruined
it
for
me
and
for
no

that
s

great
dude
the
cloak

wand
in
mystic
is
also
great
read
a
different
book
separate
the
art
from
the

harry
potter
is
still
awesome
same
i
was
obsessed
with
those
books
when
i
was
a
kid
fuck
jk
rowling
and
once
the
initial
charm
was
ripped
off
the
world
she
built
some
other
serious
problems
became
much
more
noticeable
like
how
her
characters
are
largely
cool
with
rape
via
the
use
of
love
potions
although
acknowledging
that
children
born
from
such
unions
have
naturally
broken
souls
voldemort
not
to
mention
the
tokenism
of
the
author
that
shows
she
wants
to
make
her
world
diverse
but
not
enough
to
actually
bother
to
learn
anything
about
other
ethnicities
and
cultures
before
including
them
cho
chang
there
s
a
lot
of
good
fantasy
out
there
for
those
interested
even
at
the
same
general
reading
level
as
hp
such
as
garth
nix
i
still
like
harry
potter
but
won
t
give
money
to
things
that
would
benefit
her
maybe
whoever
owns
this
is
not
a
jackass
the
worst
thing
is
that
the
wizarding
world
widely
employs
outright
slavery
and
most
of
the
main
characters
agree
that
abolition
for
house
elves
is
a
complete
joke
and
it
never
gets
resolved
or
addressed
beyond
mocking
the
situation

i
don

think
that

what
you
think
it
means
inconceivable
yes
2k
is
exorbitant
but
i
don
t
think
this

people
arguing

i
ve
lived
in
apartments
that
looked

this
when
it
s
this
bad
on
the
surface
it
only
gets
worse
the
longer
you
re
there
you
can
already
see
baseboards
missing
paint
splatter
on
the
vinyl
floor
shitty
ceiling
tile
etc
that
s
a
property
that
isn
t
properly
cared
for
which
means
there
s
a
medley
of
bigger
issues
underneath
the
surface
wouldn
t
be
surprised
to
find
plumbing
issues
shoddy
door
hinges
rodents
in
the
walls
etc
if
this
is
the
best
they
can
show
as
an
advertisement
the
actual
apartment
is
way
worse
than
we
can
imagine
unironically
if
that
listing
is
posted
on
facebook
or
other
social
media
you
should
comment
on
the
post
about
how
ridiculous
you
think
the
pricing
is

dayton

biddeford
biddeford
is

right
now
almost
moved
to

but
the
cost
of

and
the
state
those

were
in
made
me
back
track
and
withdrawal
my
acceptance
to
a
job
i
love
the
people
of
maine
and
the

itself
but
i
cannot
justify
the
cost
by
any
means
this
isn
t
that
bad
this
one
s
pretty
bad
i
saw
one
that
was
even
worse
posted
on
facebook
it
was
a
1
bd
tiny
apartment
above
someone
s
garage
in
waterboro
for
1750
a
month
no
utilities
included
an
extra
200
to
use
half
the
garage
i
almost
spit
out
my
coffee
laughing
this
morning
don
t
do
a
former

den
the
chemicals
seeps
into
the
house
and
structure
replacing
dry

alone
will
not
help
and
these
days
they
will
get
it
sale
on
lino
former

sounds
like
a
business
opportunity
i
ve
lived
in
way
worse
that

could
be
made

that

how
much
my

edit
found
the

https

j3jxdg7hemjdp47r
looks
bleak
not
the
greatest
but
based
on
it
being
part
of
the
house
it
looks
like
heat
is
included
and
maybe
even
electric
which
would
make
it
fairly
comparable
for
the
price
the
landlords
are
just
as
broke
as
everyone
else
so
they
justify
these
ridiculous
rents
because
their
overhead
has
gone
up
it
s
all
bullshit
this
is
absolutely
fucking
depressing
it
looks
very
clean
the
floor
is
shining
and
it
has
its
own
washer
dryer
hookup
i
wouldn
t
call
it
decrepit
when
there
are
actually
decrepit
places
charging
the
same
amount
too
much
money
but
not
a
bad
place
you
had
me
at
meth
den
i
wonder
how
a
graph
would
look
that
showed
rental
prices
and
homeless
population
over
time
no
washer
or
dryer
and
no
curtain
rod
for
the
shower
what
a
deal
this
looks
like
an
average
apartment
former
meth
den
lol
we
re
moving
to
maine
because
of
the
low
prices
on
everything
in
relation
to
florida
wtf
is
this
shit
better
than
most
around
my
area
it
s
not
2000
month
it
s
not
decrepit
and
it
s
clearly
not
a
former
meth
den
classy
i
really
love
those
cabinets
the
retro
look
is
nice
i
would
not
pay
that
for
that
what
is
that
boarded
up
thing
on
number
4
rent
control
now
ridiculous
people
can
t
afford
that
much
facebook
marketplace
housing
listings
are
all
scams
anyway
but
what
about
the
country
living
will
they
actually
be
able
to
find
a
tenant
for
that
at
that
price
oof
i
agree
it
s
high
but
that
s
nowhere
near
decrepit
be
thankful
they
aren
t
asking
for
more
sadly
that
s
the
state
of
the
housing
market
today
we
were
looking
for
a
place
for
months
i
had
to
literally
leave
my
job
and
move
because
the
area
i
lived
in
wanted
1500
a
month
for
a
studio
apartment
i
have
a
family
and
jobs
only
pay
so
much
around
here
it
s
sickening
to
think
that
anyone
believes
that
is
okay
most
of
them
look
like
they
haven
t
seen
any
love
since
the
90s
it
took
us
over
6
months
with
both
of
us
working
a
full
time
jobs
we
were
both
making
fairly
decent
wage
no
amount
of
money
seemed
to
matter
with
horrible
people
they
would
rent
it
to
someone
else
when
they
already
made
plans
for
me
to
meet
them
they
would
ignore
me
or
lie
to
me
when
i
would
speak
to
them
i
would
get
attitude
from
so
many
landlords
i
can
t
even
begin
to
believe
how
nutts
people
have
gotten
in
the
past
few
years
what
changed
you
can
t
tell
me
corona
made
everyone
lose
their
minds
we
have
endured
much
worse
at
this
rate
we
re
all
doomed
i
don
t
think
it
s
fair
for
you
to
bring
kids
into
this
world
and
then
complain
that
you
can
t
afford
them
disgusting
good
lord
the
nitpicking
over
over
his
choice
of
descriptor
the
point
stands
regardless
if
you
re
able
to
charge
that
much
you
can
put
in
just
a
little
bit
of
effort
to
make
it
a
little
nicer
it
doesn
t
even
have
to
be
anything
super
expensive
remote
jobs
are
going
to
kill
the
native
maine
population
and
bring
in
upper
middle
class
out
of
staters
sorry
folks
i
m
not
sure
there
s
anyway
to
fight
against
it
maine
s
a
desirable
place
and
it
s
going
to
draw
in
the
wealthy
looking
to
their
vacation
retirement
homes
if
people
are
willing
to
pay
these
kinds
of
prices
it
would
be
insane
to
charge
less
clearly
this
dudes
never
lived
in
boston
that
s
55
of
your
income
that
s
crazy
i
don
t
think
this
place
is
decrepit
at
all
outdated
sure
definitely
overpriced
and
in
need
of
some
repairs
but
i
ve
lived
in
worse
really
not
even
that
bad
honestly
looks
nicer
then
most
the
rentals
in
portland
cheaper
than
my
never
updated
2br
in
somerville
ma
which
is
a
cool
2500
third
floor
apt
with
no
use
of
back
yard
or
driveway
math
must
be
hard
for
you
20
an
hr
800
a
week
1600
for
2
people
working
or
almost
42
000
a
year
that
s
right
you
guess
it
84
000
for
2
stop
buying
8
coffee
at
starbucks
and
you
d
be
surprised
what
you
can
afford
is
meth
included
in
the
rental
or
do
i
have
to
provide
my
own
asking
for
a
friend
it
s
also
not
2k
it
s
1750
i
know
the
difference
doesn
t
seem
like
much
but
it
s
3
000
a
year
don
t
get
me
wrong
rent
is
too
high
but
in
portland
this
would
be
closer
to
2500
baseboards
missing
in
the
bathroom
closet
and
washer
dryer
alcove
stained
vinyl
flooring
in
the
bathroom
warped
drop
ceiling
tiles
curling
up
at
the
edges
rather
than
laying
flat
dirty
windows
frame
and
baseboards
just
those
surface
level
aesthetic
things
we
can
see
in
these
pictures
pictures
specially
meant
to
sell
us
on
this
apartment
show
that
this
property
isn
t
well
maintained
if
a
landlord
can
t
bother
taking
care
of
those
small
things
we
can
and
should
reasonably
assume
that
bigger
issues
like
plumbing
electrical
and
possible
infestations
are
or
would
be
ignored
you
should
look
at
potential
purchases
with
a
very
critical
eye
lest
you
be
trapped
in
a
bad
home
with
a
year
lease
frankly
i
wouldn
t
even
have
this
on
the
market
at
all
in
this
state
much
less
asking
for
over
1k
month
this
is
an
insult
to
renters
and
other
landlords
and
should
be
treated
as
such
you
should
want
better
no
only
for
yourself
but
for
your
fellow
man
i
dont
know
why
exactly
but
for
some
reason
people
in
the
last
5
years
started
using
extra
dramatic
words
and
phrases
to
describe
things
my
thoughts
exactly
none
of
the
floors
are
worn
through
and
while
op
complains
about
drop
tile
ceilings
i
m
installing
them
into
my
house
they
re
a
helluva
lot
cheaper
than
replacing
a
ceiling
and
when
they
get
water
damaged
you
replace
a
couple
tiles
instead
of
the
whole
ceiling
when
people
complain
about
stuff
like
this
i
wonder
how
many
apartments
do
you
rent
at
below
market
rates
this
is
nicer
than
anywhere
i
ve
ever
lived
lmao
came
to
say
the
same
thing
2k
is
an
evil
price
to
charge
but
op
seems
like
a
snob
who
wants
to
use
elevated
living
prices
to
disparage
addicts
that
s
what
you
re
focusing
on
the
word
decrepit
i
think
we
can
all
agree
this
apartment
isn
t
exactly
decrepit
but
it
s
not
super
well
maintained
either
considering
the
price
almost
2k
a
month
in
dayton
maine
what
a
joke
i
agree
op
should
ve
picked
another
word
but
come
on
kinda
like
those
cabinets
decrepit
in
relation
to
the
price
it
would
take
the
landlord
minimal
effort
to
redo
and
paint
everything
yes
that
is
decrepit
pretty
sure
that
was
just
a
joke
but
no
actual
washer
and
dryer
big
difference
i
m
paying
1800
a
month
nothing
included
and
no
washer
or
dryer
hookup
but
at
least
it
s
a
nice
place
1
minute
from
standish
hannaford
i
do
think
that
if
more
people
start
publicly
telling
landlords
how
ridiculous
they
are
it
could
help
there
s
too
many
apologists
out
there
who
will
jump
on
you
for
daring
to
question
the
market
rate
of
an
apartment
i
usually
give
it
a
laughing
emoji
and
move
on
it
s
so
sad
to
me
that
if
my
parents
didn
t
let
me
live
with
them
i
would
be
completely
priced
out
of
maine
and
be
forced
to
move
away
from
my
family
my
husband
and
i
moved
here
at
the
end
of
2019
for
my
job
if
i
were
looking
now
i
couldn
t
afford
it
our
house
s
value
almost
doubled
while
we
could
sell
we
wouldn
t
be
able
to
afford
much
better
there
are
cheaper
apartments
in
denver
that
are
nicer
yall
this
is
kinda
fucked
i
wanted
to
move
back
to
maine
one
day
but
at
this
rate
i
ll
likely
just
stay
in
colorado
way
overpriced
though
purchased
in
what
year
i
have
no
sympathy
for
landlords
no
man
that
s
why
i
sold
my
two
family
school
budget
kept
ballooning
and
i
was
making
a
few
hundred
a
month
taxes
overall
have
gone
way
up
in
maine
and
that
needs
to
be
paid
for
somehow
landlords
are
the
scape
goat
but
i
think
it
s
much
deeper
if
you
are
renting
you
generally
don
t
pay
attention
to
property
taxes
because
it
s
not
really
of
concern
instead
everyone
blames
the
landlord
when
a
massive
town
budget
passes
they
d
both
be
hockey
sticks
you
should
ve
done
more
research
have
you
done
any
research
i
am
from
maine
and
live
in
the
sf
bay
area
i
pay
less
per
month
for
my
one
bedroom
apartment
in
berkeley
than
if
i
were
to
move
back
to
probably
most
of
southern
maine
and
my
salary
would
be
cut
at
least
in
half
i
got
my
3br
log
home
with
a
private
sand
beach
on
a
crystal
clear
lake
off
fb
marketplace
maine
is
not
massachusetts
who
cares
what
you
pay
in
an
entirely
different
and
more
densely
populated
place
why
are
you
even
in
this
sub
i
didn
t
realize
there
was
a
starbucks
in
dayton
maine
bootlicker
now
take
taxes
out
and
see
how
much
you
re
left
with
probably
somewhere
around
58k
annually
for
2
people
then
subtract
rent
for
the
year
and
that
leaves
you
with
roughly
34k
or
2800
per
month
for
groceries
utilities
gas
car
insurance
cell
phone
possibly
other
consumer
debt
or
student
loans
to
pay
down
could
it
be
done
certainly
but
it
wouldn
t
be
easy
and
you
wouldn
t
be
getting
ahead
ever
if
you
assume
most
people
start
the
day
with
an
8
cup
of
coffee
you
re
assuming
most
people
are
already
better
off
than
they
are
also
i
like
how
you
had
to
double
the
people
staying
in
the
unit
even
though
op
doesn
t
mention
an
s
o
or
roommates
just
to
make
your
shoddy
math
make
sense
at
21k
a
year
in
rent
not
sure
how
much
of
a
difference
that
coffee
s
making
there
guy
boomer
math
some
landlords
just
care
about
things
being
well
maintained
functionally
but
don
t
care
about
aesthetics
but
in
that
case
if
it
s
a
paid
off
building
1750
does
feel
exploitative
i
guarantee
this
place
went
for
750
month
or
less
in
2004
inflation
does
not
bring
that
to
1750
not
even
close
this
is
sadistic
pricing
given
it
s
the
cost
for
someone
to
have
shelter
vocabulary
matters
yes
i
was
focusing
in
the
adjective
decrepit
worn
out
or
ruined
because
of
age
or
neglect
despicable
perhaps
decrepit
nah
decrepit
is
not
the
correct
word
to
use
here
the
rent
is
outrageous
but
just
because
something
is
not
sparkly
doesn
t
mean
it
is
not
serviceable
kind
of
a
shitty
thing
to
joke
about
in
this
context
that
kind
of
activity
legally
has
to
be
disclosed
in
a
real
estate
listing
due
to
potential
health
effects
and
the
price
would
naturally
reflect
that
no
fridge
either
surprised
there
is
a
stove
it
s
aspirational
i
prefer
to
bring
my
own
washer
and
dryer
instead
of
using
some
smelly
old
thing
that
has
had
who
knows
what
in
it
pretty
easy
to
come
up
with
them
fuck
em
who
cares
do
it
anyway
i
hear
that
i
do
it
all
the
time
and
get
absolutely
fucking
berated
for
questioning
why
property
owners
have
to
make
a
killing
off
of
creating
misfortune
for
others
the
apologists
are
other
landlords
if
people
are
buying
paying
the
market
rate
and
places
don
t
sit
on
the
market
for
an
extended
period
of
time
then
the
market
rate
is
what
it
s
supposed
to
be
i
know
this
is
a
hard
thing
to
stomach
i
know
it
really
sucks
for
the
bottom
80
of
earners
in
society
same
here
in
pa
i
don
t
live
in
an
affluent
area
but
for
some
reason
housing
and
land
prices
are
completely
detached
from
reality
i
look
around
and
wonder
who
is
buying
these
1200
sqft
houses
for
400k
in
my
area
guess
i
m
living
at
home
and
saving
for
10
more
years
teach
your
parents
well
their
children
s
hell
will
slowly
go
by
typical
now
though
july
2020
agreed
property
tax
is
rising
because
of
the
real
estate
bubble
these
guys
could
sell
today
and
make
out
like
bandits
while
opening
up
some
properties
for
people
to
live
in
nope
they
want
to
speculate
that
prices
will
go
up
faster
than
inflation
forever
i
see
that
side
of
it
i
would
argue
that
like
any
other
investment
there
are
risks
and
a
chance
of
less
return
the
rental
market
was
always
a
solid
virtually
full
proof
way
to
make
extra
money
but
with
the
volatility
of
the
housing
market
and
the
wild
increases
in
property
taxes
across
the
country
this
risk
has
gone
up
considerably
that
being
said
i
can
see
how
it
s
easy
for
a
renter
to
point
the
finger
at
the
landlord
without
sympathy
and
vice
versa
central
maine
has
great
prices
but
that
spot
is
both
crazy
on
price
and
nasty
lmao
i
was
commenting
how
also
shitty
the
experience
is
else
where
i
used
to
live
in
maine
is
an
hour
drive
it
s
not
some
fucking
fantasy
place
on
the
otherside
of
the
wardrobe
math
can
be
a
struggle
for
those
who
lack
formal
education
i
understand
you
shouldn
t
be
mad
at
the
people
who
are
providing
others
with
places
to
live
you
should
be
mad
that
like
4
people
hold
more
wealth
than
like
50
of
the
lowest
americans
the
system
is
rigged
against
the
working
class
but
it
s
not
people
like
this
older
fella
who
are
the
problem
well
nobody
ever
cares
what
you
bring
home
everything
is
based
off
gross
we
all
know
maine
is
awful
on
tax
and
new
the
new
fmla
tax
is
being
added
we
are
screwed
i
also
never
said
it
would
be
easy
but
it
can
be
done
was
my
point
it
is
2br
the
op
also
does
not
list
the
correct
price
of
the
unit
or
any
amities
but
he
did
mention
a
family
living
in
the
unit
so
there
is
that
don
t
be
dumb
i
highly
doubt
you
are
that
tough
its
not
about
the
coffee
the
coffee
was
just
an
example
of
living
outside
of
our
means
we
are
all
guilty
of
it
i
m
not
excluding
anybody
including
myself
truth
in
2004
2015
land
house
values
in
inland
maine
were
very
low
under
priced
now
they
are
teetering
on
overpriced
but
dayton
is
literally
20
minutes
from
the
ocean
there
s
pretty
much
no
places
in
new
england
within
20
minutes
of
the
ocean
that
are
reasonably
priced
or
affordable
for
low
income
earners
this
is
in
no
way
shape
or
form
sadistic
pricing
do
you
understand
what
that
means
this
person
is
probably
just
charging
market
rent
for
that
area
does
it
suck
of
course
it
does
however
charging
market
rent
even
if
market
rent
is
really
high
is
in
not
evil
or
nefarious
or
anything
of
the
sort
unless
the
person
is
already
a
billionaire
people
love
being
overly
dramatic
about
things
these
days
what
they
don
t
realize
is
it
makes
other
people
who
they
are
trying
to
communicate
with
not
take
them
very
seriously
that
apartment
is
worn
out
and
ruined
because
of
age
and
neglect
so
it
would
seem
quite
decrepit
it
is
correct
decrepit
worn
out
or
ruined
because
of
age
or
neglect
this
apartment
is
visibly
worn
out
and
ruined
because
of
age
and
neglect
in
the
link
someone
commented
to
the
actual
facebook
post
of
this
listing
there
is
a
fridge
listed
and
shown
in
one
of
the
pictures
it
s
an
old
fridge
don
t
get
me
wrong
but
it
goes
with
the
stove
good
then
the
landlord
should
get
some
lmao
bottom
80
how
long
before
that
metric
is
the
bottom
90
bottom
99
we
re
talking
about
shelter
for
fucks
sake
and
you
re
saying
oh
wow
sucks
to
be
80
of
the
population
smart
true
it
s
a
shame
i
wouldn
t
say
central
maine
has
great
rental
prices
either
especially
compared
to
salaries
hourly
pay
as
someone
who
has
lived
in
fl
and
pa
and
now
lives
in
maine
i
can
assure
you
it
s
not
cheaper
it
seems
cheaper
but
the
only
things
cheaper
are
absolutely
shit
places
to
live
in
either
high
crime
high
homeless
areas
slumlords
or
a
beautiful
mix
of
both
and
everything
is
far
as
fuck
away
and
it
s
cold
as
hell
with
all
that
being
said
i
got
extremely
lucky
in
northern
maine
with
my
place
and
would
never
ever
leave
eta
it
took
me
9
years
of
grinding
and
shit
places
to
get
to
where
i
am
today
yeah
but
they
want
it
to
be
if
you
don
t
understand
the
difference
you
didn
t
learn
much
during
your
time
in
maine
maybe
you
should
tell
that
to
the
person
calculating
the
cost
of
coffees
on
here
i
can
be
angry
at
landlords
who
make
money
off
of
things
people
need
to
survive
and
i
can
be
angry
at
billionaires
and
i
can
be
angry
at
you
too
go
fuck
yourself
this
trend
of
minimizing
things
down
to
petty
spending
while
our
entire
economy
is
based
on
said
spending
is
tired
it
s
not
about
the
cup
of
coffee
or
bootstraps
or
avocado
toast
use
this
as
an
opportunity
to
rethink
the
8
coffee
meme
being
a
landlord
is
sadistic
regardless
of
what
you
charge
the
entire
concept
of
land
ownership
is
flawed
but
that
s
another
conversation
and
i
dont
expect
you
to
agree
with
me
the
apartment
is
clean
looks
very
livable
the
whole
state
is
worn
out
old
fridges
cost
soooo
much
in
electric
bills
i
m
from
new
hampshire
lmao
try
again
little
big
man
syndrome
in
action
let
me
be
mad
and
complain
while
i
don
t
do
anything
but
complain
on
reddit
join
some
boards
get
involved
don
t
just
be
a
punk
in
a
like
minded
echo
chamber
if
anyone
is
licking
boots
it
s
you
my
man
do
you
understand
what
the
definition
of
sadistic
is
the
entire
country
is
worn
out
i
m
sure
depending
on
who
you
ask
a
dumpster
can
be
clean
and
livable
there
is
clearly
not
a
dollar
invested
in
the
unit
in
the
last
at
least
20
years
the
rent
is
almost
20
500
annually
just
to
go
straight
into
some
slumlords
pocked
with
zero
upkeep
it
is
not
clean
look
at
the
heater
vents
looks
like
soot
from
the
furnace
clearly
the
beginnings
of
mold
growth
likely
from
a
leak
in
the
ceiling
to
a
homeless
personal
maybe
you
said
you
used
to
live
in
maine
not
me
strike
3
for
you
dude
you
re
not
a
true
mainer
therefore
you
are
invalid
although
and
i
do
100
agree
w
op
i
wonder
how
much
the
taxes
are
on
this
place
especially
since
it
s
so
close
to
the
ocean
and
i
bet
there
s
been
a
lot
of
new
homes
in
area
jacking
up
property
values
idk
i
see
a
new
150
home
depot
vanity
and
a
500
range
next
to
the
50
s
kitchen
cabinets
pretty
f
n
sad
shape
yes
to
any
person
you
cannot
start
your
life
out
i
penthouse
accommodations
the
price
is
too
high
for
this
part
want
but
it
is
clean
looking
and
livable
words
matter
lmao
i
ll
give
you
the
range
but
the
vanity
doesn
t
count
lol
are
we
looking
at
the
same
pictures
here
there
s
a
middle
ground
this
looks
like
a
crackhouse
and
it
s
not
even
clean
thanks
they
probly
got
it
used
anyhow
fantastic
view
looks
peaceful
gorgeous
thank
you
it
s
always
nice
out
there
it
s
my
happy
place
thank
you
that
doesn
t
look
like
allen
s
coffee
brandy
to
me
bub
crown
royal
maple
and
moxie
tastes
just
like
a
belgian
waffle
i
shit
you
not
pine
bitters
that
s
a
new
one
where
d
you
get
em
for
the
moxie
alone
we
salute
you
my
grandmother
always
mixed
moxie
w
milk
so
that
s
how
i
grew
up
drinking
it
when
i
got
older
just
added
vodka
but
your
way
w
pine
bitters
looks
great
looks
delicious
where
s
the
allen
s
coffee
brandy
and
the
gallon
of
milk
even
thinking
that
makes
me
gag
i
can
t
consume
drinks
with
dairy
in
it
because
of
that
crap
i
d
enjoy
a
glass
of
that
though
i
bet
wild
bevy
is
great
i
like
forij
their
rose
gin
and
their
cocktail
selections
ooh
pine
bitters
how
are
those
bitters
not
judging
but
i
can
t
imagine
mixing
an
expensive
whiskey
with
moxie
that
s
what
old
grand
dad
or
wild
turkey
is
for
moxie
and
rum
build
in
a
glass
over
ice
5
oz

huh
this
is
probably
pretty
good
oh
god
this
reminds
me
of
one
summer
when
i
went
back
home
to
see
the
folks
i
was
probably
24
the
power
went
out
parents
and
their
best
friends
got
trashed
i
mean
trashed
dad
and
his
best
friend
decided
they
wanted
to
make
mainah
libres
as
they
decided
rum
and
moxies
should
be
called
but
had
no
moxie
mom
was
going
to
run
to
the
store
to
get
some
but
thankfully
before
she
got
in
the
car
we
discovered
that
the
waters
she
was
drinking
between
cups
of
wine
to
pace
herself
were
actually
just
straight
vodka
so
i
got
sent
to
gather
all
the
moxie
on
the
island
which
was
said
very
grandly
despite
it
being
a
small
island
with
just
one
convenience
store
roughly
the
size
of
a
converted
one
room
schoolhouse
but
i
obliged
15
20
oz
bottles
of
moxie
later
i
walk
back
in
the
house
to
discover
my
fathers
friend
on
the
roof
in
his
underwear
constructing
an
elaborate
2
story
tall
drink
luge
out
of
pvc
that
my
dad
somehow
cut
in
half
lengthwise
without
losing
a
single
finger
duct
tape
and
seran
wrap
and
that
s
why
we
had
bees
on
the
roof
every
summer
for
years
till
i
imagine
every
last
single
solidary
molecule
of
sucrose
bound
moxie
had
been
excised
from
the
shingles
by
their
buzzy
little
feet
and
fed
to
the
baby
bee
larva
who
probably
emerged
from
their
little
hexagonal
pods
as
alcoholics
how
is
topknot
that
looks
like
a
tasty
idea
if
i
wasn
t
working
in
the
am
i
would
do
the
same
i
m
glad
to
hear
the
wild
bevy
is
doing
so
well
they
put
a
lot
of
energy
into
following
their
dreams
cheers
damn
it
i
miss
moxie
it
was
at
one
supermarket
in
wallingford
now
i
can
t
find
the
cans
anymore
aya
that
shit
will
get
ya
right
sideways
bub
bout
like
a
skinned
cat
save
some
for
thursday
after
this
years
wind
storm
i
make
mainehattans
2
oz
bourbon
1
oz
sweet
vermouth
1
oz
moxie
dash
of
bitters
on
the
rocks
with
a
cherry
i
use
to
drink
vodka
and
moxie
haha
toxic
moxie
we
use
to
call
it
what
else
do
you
make
with
the
pine
bitters
try
dark
rum
and
moxie
quite
nice
this
is
the
way
a
mainehattan
i
love
it
the
only
thing
that
might
make
that
image
a
little
more
quintessentially
maine
is
if
you
d
put
a
little
sprig
of
pine
needles
as
a
gahnish
on
your
drink
you
re
not
supposed
to
put
a
after
proof
proof
is
double
the
percentage
never
thought
about
mixing
whiskey
with
moxie
how
did
it
taste
seems
like
a
waste
of
expensive
whiskey
to
me
the
flavor
of
moxie
is
strong
enough
to
mask
a
lot
of
the
whiskey
s
flavors
no
moxie
is
the
only
common
maine
drink
shown
here
the
rest
is
transplant
flatlander
juice
a
shot
of
bleach
kinda
smooths
out
that
medicinal
algae
taste
of
moxie
noooo
at
first
i
thought
the
little
brown
bottle
on
the
right
was
some
old
cough
syrup
you
found
probably
would
have
made
the
moxie
taste
better
s
always
down
vote
the
poison
herbs
for
me
please
as
a
mcgillicuddy
s
man
myself
there
are
nowhere
near
enough
discarded
nips
in
this
picture
for
it
to
be
in
maine
fackin
tell
em
bub
if
yaint
got
some
moose
juice
with
a
splash
of
oakhursts
witcha
then
ya
better
friggin
figure
it
out
theya
bahb
i
laughed
way
too
hard
at
this
thank
you
came
here
to
say
this
i
only
came
here
to
make
this
exact
comment
came
here
to
ask
about
allen
s
also
no
bud
heavy
til
there
are
people
that
like
to
drink
waffles
moxie
and
orloff
tastes
just
like
moxie
and
orloff
i
did
crown
royal
apple
and
moxie
that
was
delicious
i
still
drink
plain
crown
and
moxie
i
named
it
a
king
of
spain
heritage
seaweed
in
portland
want
maine
russian
moxie
and
milk
is
really
good
tbh
in
my
last
trip
i
got
their
slack
tide
pine
kelp
and
sea
salt
gin
but
the
year
before
that
i
got
that
butterfly
pea
flower
gin
the
rose
is
probably
my
next
one
honestly
hard
to
notice
easily
but
i
like
having
them
honestly
this
whiskey
wasn
t
too
expensive
they
have
some
closer
to
100
but
this
particular
bottle
was
closer
to
50
and
i
9
times
out
of
10
drink
it
straight
but
today
wanted
to
make
a
maine
mixed
drink
lol
you
beat
me
to
posting
that
video
the
mud
in
yer
eye
is
pretty
good
i
used
hardshore
original
gin
to
keep
it
in
maine
as
much
as
possible
rinse
glass
with
absinthe
build
in
glass
over
ice
25
oz
or
7
ml
maraschino
1
oz
or
30
ml
gin
5
oz
or
15
ml
lime
juice
3
oz
or
90
ml
moxie
stir
astringent
they
should
stick
to
clear
liquors
so
topknot
is
the
name
they
use
for
all
of
their
whiskeys
and
so
i
ve
had
two
one
was
a
maple
barrel
aged
bourbon
and
while
it
had
a
little
burn
the
maple
flavor
was
exquisite
and
this
whiskey
actually
is
kind
of
surprising
for
how
good
it
is
i
wasn
t
planning
on
getting
it
but
you
get
some
nice
sweetness
cherry
notes
and
a
little
cinnamon
spice
i
think
i
m
a
huge
fan
of
what
they
produce
i
definitely
recommend
apparently
decent
lol
i
don
t
think
anything
in
particular
i
just
use
it
to
add
a
little
intrigue
to
my
drinks
omg
how
have
i
never
noticed
that
actually
really
good
i
feel
like
it
brought
out
a
lot
of
the
subtleties
of
the
moxie
like
i
got
some
cinnamon
fernet
is
a
really
good
pairing
too
if
you
can
find
it
it
wasn
t
that
expensive
around
50
i
normally
drink
it
straight
but
tonight
i
wanted
a
maine
drink
is
moose
juice
a
real
thing
or
that
slang
for
something
people
do
a
whole
lot
more
to
waffles
than
you
may
think
i
don
t
like
to
kink
shame
but
holy
fuck
bub
sounds
like
it
tastes
like
college
at
umaine
sounds
more
exotic
than
a
white
mainer
i
imagine
that
s
especially
true
with
the
moxie
having
gentian
root
as
the
main
flavor
hey
more
power
to
you
i
bartended
during
my
undergrad
and
had
a
customer
order
a
three
finger
pour
of
johnny
walker
blue
bars
have
a
huge
up
charge
and
even
14
years
ago
that
was
a
200
250
dollar
drink
he
sipped
it
made
a
face
and
asked
for
a
redbull
to
mix
it
with
if
that
s
what
you
want
go
for
it
nothing
wrong
with
drinking
it
whatever
way
you
like
it
cheers
double
malt
would
end
my
liver
50
is
expensive
to
mix
with
a
soda
ahoy
round
turn
distilling
biddeford
makers
of
bimini
gin
is
way
better
but
the
wild
bevy
ppl
clearly
have
more
wiggly
bridge
is
better
for
whiskey
because
they
ve
been
at
it
i
love
all
of
these
folks
personally
we
have
history
because
i
grew
up
there
but
rts
is
my
favorite
based
on
quality
gotta
love
those
derpy
little
dinosaurs
they
run
funny
they
fly
funny
the
only
downside
is
when
they
take
off
roadside
they
get
to
exactly
windshield
height
could
have
been
a
coordinated
strike
turkeys
in
my
moms
yard
have
been
laying
siege
to
a
stack
of
foam
insulation
by
the
shed
when
they
want
something
gone
it
shows
with
god
as
my
witness
i
thought
turkeys
could
fly
true
story
one
day
there
was
a
few
turkeys
outside
my
house
and
when
i
stepped
outside
they
were
desperately
trying
to
fly
away
as
quick
as
possible
one
landed
on
a
dead
tree
across
the
road
and
all
of
a
sudden
i
hear
snap
and
see
a
turkey
once
again
trying
and
this
time
failing
to
take
off
before
landing
on
another
branch
of
the
same
dead
tree
i
don
t
think
i
d
ever
laughed
so
hard
in
my
life
the
one
on
the
right
looks
like
a
wile
e
coyote
witness
mark
you
sure
it
s
not
raining
alligators
whump
whump
love
it
derpy
little
dinosaurs
really
feared
that
when
i
drove
motorcycles
or
when
some
idiot
tom
sees
its
reflection
in
the
side
of
your
car
and
decides
to
fight
it
or
when
another
tom
sees
its
reflection
in
your
basement
window
and
decides
to
fight
the
window
while
you
re
working
at
home
and
it
sounds
like
someone
is
breaking
in
we
don
t
have
alligator
rain
season
til
may
here
in
maine
thank
you
mods
hey
there
i
m
from
here
and
live
here
looking
for
a
part
time
job
and
i
m
super
intimidated
to
apply
at
places
bc
i
ve
been
a
sahm
for
6
years
i
ve
started
my
own
online
boutique
that
s
done
very
well
but
it
s
so
time
consuming
and
as
a
single
mom
i
need
extra
income
that
i
can
leave
work
at
work
if
that
makes
sense
the
hustle
life
is
killing
me
if
you
recommend
a
company
that
you
know
is
hiring
plz
lmk
ofc
i
can
look
at
indeed
for
listings
etc
but
someone
made
a
post
here
the
other
day
wondering
why
they
couldn
t
find
help
so
hoping
maybe
someone
might
see
this
eta
i
m
in
western
maine
40
min
from
conway
about
an
hour
to
portland
35
min
to
windham
if
that
helps
can
an
auto
mod
tell
text
posters
that
tourism
question
posts
are
prohibited
before
they
post
so
my
husband
and
i
are
currently
living
outside
of
denver
co
and
are
considering
moving
to
the
portland
me
area
i
am
originally
from
nj
and
he
is
originally
from
berlin
we
know
we
like
the
area
since
my
aunt
and
uncle
live
in
gorham
so
i
personally
have
visited
a
lot
over
the
years
growing
up
i
m
wondering
how
people
who
have
lived
in
that
area
for
a
while
really
anywhere
within
45mins
to
an
hour
outside
of
portland
like
living
there
we
have
a
4
year
old
and
another
baby
on
the
way
so
we
really
want
something
that
has
decent
schools
and
is
family
oriented
i
m
in
architecture
and
my
husband
is
in
it
project
managing
is
it
a
good
place
to
live
to
raise
a
family
is
it
super
hard
to
find
jobs
i
ve
asked
my
aunt
this
stuff
and
she
says
the
prices
of
houses
are
high
and
it
s
not
as
rural
as
it
used
to
be
but
comparing
the
prices
of
houses
and
population
density
to
that
of
denver
you
re
much
better
off
in
maine
i
d
say
i
m
looking
to
move
from
the
midwest
working
as
a
correctional
officer
in
a
men
s
maximum
security
prison
to
maine
are
there
any
places
you
d
recommend
trying
to
transfer
to
i
was
thinking
warren
i
think
and
is
there
any
kind
of
6
month
lease
place
available
around
there
so
if
it
doesn
t
workout
i
can
come
back
i
purchased
flights
for
my
fiance
s
30th
birthday
for
us
to
visit
the
northeast
to
see
the
fall
colors
i
have
us
landing
in
vermont
oct
15
and
heading
to
acadia
and
down
to
boston
by
the
21st
to
go
home
my
research
said
this
was
pretty
much
the
peak
for
southern
maine
i
m
now
seeing
reports
that
colors
might
be
coming
early
this
year
and
we
would
maybe
even
be
a
week
past
peak
when
we
arrive
1
what
are
the
most
accurate
reports
to
consider
does
this
seem
accurate
2
what
does
past
peak
really
mean
to
me
will
the
leaves
just
not
be
as
spectacular
or
will
i
arrive
to
find
a
bunch
of
sticks
hi
all
i
am
getting
a
job
in
augusta
well
i
m
in
the
process
but
it
seems
like
the
applicant
pool
is
small
so
i
think
i
m
gonna
get
the
job
i
am
f23
and
i
do
enjoy
night
life
i
m
part
of
my
local
goth
metal
scenes
i
also
am
happy
to
live
in
a
more
wooded
naturey
area
or
in
a
more
urban
setting
i
just
wanna
be
near
other
young
people
and
make
friends
where
in
me
would
be
a
good
place
to
move
i
am
willing
to
commute
a
little
bit
to
get
to
work
in
augusta
thanks
hi
husband
and
i
are
considering
a
move
to
maine
we
both
grew
up
in
west
virginia
and
currently
reside
in
alaska
we
have
lived
a
few
different
places
since
my
husband
was
in
the
navy
and
we
haven
t
quite
found
an
area
we
feel
super
content
with
alaska
is
gorgeous
and
we
moved
after
his
was
out
of
the
navy
and
have
had
a
blast
even
bought
a
house
but
the
winters
and
never
ending
darkness
is
starting
to
affect
mental
health
so
we
believe
for
us
to
feel
better
in
the
long
term
we
should
move
somewhere
that
gets
nice
cold
winters
but
without
7
months
of
darkness
about
us
we
love
harbor
towns
and
it
s
partially
why
we
love
alaska
washington
state
we
both
enjoy
hiking
my
husband
is
an
aviation
mechanic
and
i
currently
work
in
communications
in
the
nonprofit
sector
we
like
roadtrips
and
overall
i
d
say
we
re
very
outdoorsy
since
our
families
are
getting
older
and
the
dark
winters
are
wearing
on
us
we
have
decided
to
consider
maine
or
vermont
since
they
re
more
progressive
than
nh
would
be
both
states
seem
to
have
some
pretty
good
hiking
jobs
and
the
housing
is
definitely
no
more
expensive
than
what
we
paid
for
in
alaska
we
have
3
pets
2
cats
1
dog
and
no
kids
knowing
what
was
mentioned
above
do
you
think
maine
any
region
would
be
worth
visiting
and
seeing
if
it
could
be
worth
the
move
thanks
again
for
any
and
all
info
i
always
want
to
take
a
ferry
to
one
of
those
islands
such
as
vinalhaven
north
haven
isle
au
haut
and
swans
island
but
i
have
two
major
concerns
first
since
i
do
not
plan
to
take
my
car
or
bike
or
any
similar
thing
with
me
which
island
is
more
walk
friendly
so
that
i
can
visit
some
interesting
places
on
foot
second
i
always
have
this
worry
that
i
may
not
be
able
to
come
back
on
time
is
a
spot
on
a
ferry
guaranteed
if
i
can
select
a
specific
time
is
it
possible
that
my
ride
is
full
before
i
get
on
so
i
have
to
stay
on
an
island
overnight
thank
you
deleted
hi
everyone
i
m
heading
to
portland
tomorrow
i
m
just
wondering
if
there
are
any
spots
nearby
that
i
can
see
some
beavers
i
m
from
australia
so
for
me
it
would
be
super
exciting
thanks
we
live
in
tennessee
and
summers
are
literally
killing
me
i
have
multiple
sclerosis
and
am
severely
affected
by
the
heat
i
have
to
get
out
my
wife
loves
tennessee
but
she
understands
my
first
choice
is
montana
followed
by
colorado
she
hates
both
of
those
places
we
did
a
trip
to
new
england
a
few
years
ago
only
place
she
will
agree
to
move
is
maine
we
are
a
couple
in
our
40s
with
no
kids
3
cats
and
2
dogs
remote
job
wife
is
an
immigrant
from
ukraine
us
citizen
8
years
she
would
love
to
volunteer
and
make
friends
with
similar
people
where
do
you
suggest
we
look
on
moving
only
place
i
ve
kinda
ruled
out
is
portland
considering
a
distant
future
probably
move
to
maine
from
florida
i
ve
never
been
but
my
dad
wanted
to
move
there
after
one
visit
and
he
s
lived
all
over
the
u
s
he
actually
asked
me
to
move
there
so
he
could
have
reasons
to
visit
what
would
be
good
times
to
visit
to
get
a
better
idea
of
what
it
would
be
like
to
live
there
i
read
that
lyme
disease
is
less
prevalent
in
northern
maine
is
that
correct
i
spend
much
of
the
bearable
weather
outside
so
ticks
are
a
concern
what
areas
have
more
access
to
outdoor
locations
like
hiking
trails
parks
and
so
on
hi
all
my
wife
and
i
late
20s
early
30s
are
planning
a
road
trip
to
your
lovely
state
of
maine
in
mid
october
with
hopes
to
see
some
incredible
fall
foliage
eat
awesome
seafood
lobster
scenic
viewpoints
and
enjoy
the
coastal
towns
and
all
that
the
place
has
to
offer
our
entire
time
in
maine
will
be
officially
from
october
12th
night
to
16th
morning
we
re
driving
down
from
ontario
and
will
arrive
in
maine
on
the
night
of
october
12th
sleeping
near
bangor
oct
13
we
re
planning
to
visit
acadia
np
and
bar
harbour
end
the
day
near
camden
at
our
hotel
i
don
t
expect
us
to
have
too

i
looking
in
the

place
we
re

take
a

today
i
m
googling
and
not
sure
where
to
go

many
options
so

i
have
these
random
ideas
from
internet
travel

and

hello
my
wife
and
i
are
thinking
of
a
return
to
maine
i
grew
up
in
the
dover
foxcroft
area
but
left
in
the
early
2000s
and
have
only
returned
sporadically
for
visits
but
i
do
miss
the
atmosphere
and
culture
and
pace
of
life
housing
though
seems
to
have
gotten
crazy
not
as
bad
as
nh
or
oh
though
where
i
ve
lived
recently
we
are
thinking
of
either
augusta
waterville
or
somewhere
along
the
coast
where
we
can
find
something
for
200
300k
if
possible
this
is
kind
of
a
niche
community
as
well
but
is
there
a
decent
rpg
or
tabletop
gaming
area
other
than
probably
portland
an
bangor
maybe
i
would
assume
thanks
hello
i
m
looking
to
move
to
maine
in
the
new
year
but
don
t
have
any
potential
roommates
i
m
23f
and
looking
to
live
with
grad
students
or
young
professionals
and
want
to
live
in
literally
anywhere
in
between
north
berwick
and
portland
doesn
t
need
to
be
on
the
coast
does
anyone
have
any
resources
where
i
could
look
for
roomates
tia
looking
for
pick
up
rec
soccer
or
futsal
in
the
bangor
downeast
area
for
adult
beginners
good
day
all
my
girlfriend
and
i
are
both
photographers
and
will
be
visiting
portland
for
a
few
days
during
the
last
week
of
october
we
ll
be
driving
from
nova
scotia
and
are
looking
for
some
suggestions
of
some
photo
worthy
locations
we
can
scout
and
adventure
to
during
our
visit
we
re
staying
in
portland
but
don
t
mind
driving
an
hour
to
get
somewhere
as
long
as
it
s
worth
it
what
is
the
augusta
area
community
like
how
would
it
be
to
try
to
make
new
friends
as
early
30s
outdoorsy
no
kids
yet
i
grew
up
in
southern
maine
but
have
lived
in
the
west
coast
for
several
years
now
i
am
thinking
about
moving
back
to
maine
and
am
intrigued
by
augusta
it
seems
like
a
place
one
could
reasonably
afford
housing
in
walking
biking
distance
from
work
and
other
town
activities
though
i
am
concerned
about
having
to
start
over
socially
at
this
point
in
life
i
have
a
decent
shot
at
getting
offered
a
job
in
maine
it
would
be
near
wells
me
in
york
county
i
m
really
into
the
outdoors
animals
nature
loved
alaska
aside
from
the
meth
and
air
of
hopelessness
and
am
keen
to
escape
the
scorching
summers
of
the
south
and
ideally
some
of
the
traffic
and
busy
ness
of
where
i
currently
live
1
i
should
be
bringing
home
about
95k
post
tax
retirement
contributions
is
this
enough
for
two
adults
potentially
two
adults
and
a
child
2
is
maine
a
good
place
to
grow
up
did
you
enjoy
your
childhood
there
3
my
job
is
federal
nothing
particularly
controversial
is
there
much
anti
government
sentiment
in
that
area
4
anything
else
i
should
know
before
coming
there
i
ve
moved
several
places
without
ever
visiting
ak
fl
hi
and
i
m
sure
i
could
adapt
but
worth
asking
5
any
input
on
the
va
facilities
nearby
i
ll
be
in
dover
foxcroft
for
3
months
starting
in
january
i
m
just
wondering
if
there
s
any
must
do
things
that
are
nearby
and
also
should
i
get
a
heavy
coat
and
snow
boots
midwest
cold
doesn
t
bother
me
but
idk
what
the
winters
are
like
on
the
east
coasts
myself
my
husband
and
four
friends
are
traveling
to
maine
next
september
hoping
to
stay
within
an
hour
of
bangor
and
here
s
the
kicker
we
re
looking
for
a
secluded
spooky
cabin
doesn
t
have
to
have
the
bells
and
whistles
hot
tub
etc
but
a
c
and
heat
is
a
preference
think
cabin
in
the
woods
evil
dead
the
likes
of
those
hey
y
all
im
preparing
to
move
myself
my
partner
and
potentially
is
brother
in
law
somewhere
near
the
coastal
cities
since
i
want
to
be
near
enough
to
brunswick
to
consider
the
train
im
doing
this
in
order
to
escape
the
state
of
georgia
in
light
of
recent
events
my
partner
is
a
ga
native
but
i
grew
up
in
ny
anything
we
should
be
aware
of
or
any
resources
that
could
help
thanks
in
advance
edit
for
further
context
this
is
a
burner
account
because
i
am
trans
and
really
dont
want
random
people
finding
out
where
im
moving
to
etc
my
partner
is
cis
but
not
exactly
straight
we
were
aware
of
maine
s
protections
and
status
as
a
safe
state
for
some
time
but
if
i
dont
pull
the
trigger
on
this
now
im
going
to
be
stuck
here
forever
anyway
hope
that
helps
im
not
very
good
at
reddit
lol
how
do
mainers
perceive
someone
giving
a
quick
couple
flash
of
the
high
beams
while
driving
they
take
it
as
an
insult
or
a
warning
out
here
hi
my
friend
and
i
would
love
to
spend
6
10
days
in
maine
in
february
i
m
realizing
how
vast
varied
and
gorgeous
your
state
is
feels
like
we
should
spend
a
month
i
m
also
coming
to
understand
that
winter
may
limit
access
to
some
places
but
we
re
excited
to
be
in
winter
we
d
like
to
see
acadia
spend
time
near
the
water
ice
fish
visit
some
funky
towns
enjoy
some
gorgeous
mountains
mountain
activities
given
that
can
someone
please
offer
a
a
town
that
would
be
a
good
jumping
off
point
to
drive
out
and
back
each
day
or
b
a
route
that
would
take
us
to
do
all
these
things
we
re
interested
salt
of
the
earth
places
with
gorgeous
scenery
fancy
hand
bags
and
boutiques
aren
t
our
jam
as
i
m
looking
i
m
realizing
not
all
of
our
desires
are
in
the
same
part
of
the
state
thanks
in
advance
and
much
appreciated
evening
my
soon
to
be
husband
and
i
are
honeymooning
in
maine
in
early
november
we
have
visited
twice
before
mid
may
mid
september
as
we
have
a
good
friend
that
is
a
native
mainer
and
owns
a
small
vacation
home
in
biddeford
that
we
use
during
our
visits
i
know
she
s
the
best
and
most
generous
she
doesn
t
usually
visit
during
early
november
prefers
to
fly
up
for
prelude
so
she
didn
t
have
many
details
to
provide
other
than
it
s
much
quieter
during
the
month
so
redditors
we
were
curious
about
a
few
things
1
we
both
love
hiking
visited
bar
harbor
acadia
on
our
last
trip
is
the
hiking
in
much
closer
new
hampshire
worth
it
during
that
time
of
year
or
would
it
be
pretty
restricted
due
to
weather
2
we
ve
visited
alot
of
coastal
towns
york
ogunquit
kennebunkport
camden
damariscotta
but
not
yet
boothbay
i
know
their
botanic
gardens
have
a
gorgeous
christmas
display
but
it
won
t
be
there
when
we
are
visiting
still
a
worthy
visit
3
any
apple
orchards
that
are
worth
a
stop
maybe
1
hr
from
kennebunkport
area
i
ve
googled
and
saw
randall
orchards
and
the
apple
farm
are
open
into
november
most
others
that
i
ve
looked
into
seem
to
close
in
october
4
we
loved
peaks
island
during
our
may
visit
weather
dependent
is
it
worth
another
stop
during
an
inevitably
chilly
time
ultimately
we
know
this
is
a
quiet
month
but
if
there
are
any
recommendations
we
would
love
to
hear
them
thank
you
so
much
i
currently
live
in
reno
nv
i
was
born
and
grew
up
in
rural
nevada
and
have
only
lived
out
west
in
the
desert
reno
salt
lake
city
phoenix
and
i
am
over
it
i
hate
the
desert
i
love
the
cold
i
love
the
snow
i
love
trees
and
water
there
are
nice
places
with
trees
and
water
near
here
but
unfortunately
i
m
not
a
multi
millionaire
so
i
can
t
afford
to
move
to
any
of
those
places
lake
tahoe
is
the
dream
but
i
ll
never
be
able
to
afford
it
i
work
from
home
and
am
in
the
tech
field
i
make
decent
money
but
will
never
be
able
to
afford
a
house
here
in
reno
where
the
average
home
price
is
over
half
a
million
dollars
i
have
been
looking
around
places
and
there
are
decent
houses
in
maine
by
awesome
looking
lakes
and
or
rivers
that
are
only
like
300k
which
is
something
i
can
afford
i
m
in
my
40s
and
am
perfectly
healthy
so
no
medical
concerns
i
see
a
lot
of
people
in
this
thread
have
mentioned
finding
a
pcp
can
be
difficult
and
really
can
t
think
of
any
other
reason
to
not
move
to
maine
i
have
a
couple
of
questions
first
off
is
there
anything
i
haven
t
thought
of
that
would
be
a
reason
to
not
move
to
maine
secondly
where
is
a
good
place
to
look
for
a
place
to
rent
if
i
do
it
move
it
ll
be
an
expensive
process
so
i
need
to
find
a
reasonably
priced
place
to
rent
with
high
speed
internet
necessary
for
my
work
and
preferably
somewhere
near
a
lake
or
river
or
even
the
ocean
though
i
imagine
places
along
the
coast
are
the
most
expensive
bar
harbor
and
camden
in
november
i
m
planning
a
trip
to
maine
in
november
before
thanksgiving
and
i
m
just
wondering
if
there
will
be
a
lot
of
restaurants
cafes
shops
etc
closed
at
that
point
in
november
the
trip
is
mostly
for
the
scenery
but
significant
closures
of
businesses
might
impact
the
trip
also
what
should
my
expectations
be
for
acadia
national
park
in
mid
november
will
there
still
be
plenty
of
hiking
and
parking
thanks
in
advance
for
any
insight
what
are
your
go
to
resources
to
look
for
apartment
especially

y
all
i
am
going
to
be
going
up
to
york
for
an
interview
in
the
coming
weeks
and
i
m
just
trying
to
learn
everything
we
possibly
get
an
offer
and
move
we
would
be
coming
from
oklahoma
so
we
know
it
will
be
a
huge
change
of
life
but
it
s
one
that
we
welcome
just
a
general
question
like
where
in
the
general
viscinity
of
york
would
be
good
places
to
avoid
what
are
job
prospects
for
someone
in
retail
and
also
what
are
the
general
feelings
on
living
there
sorry
i
am
a
little
vague
on
details
as
things
are
positive
but
still
really
fluid
any
kind
of
help
or
info
would
be
immensely
appreciated
edit
spelling
hi
all
we
plan
to
move
to
southern
maine
in
the
next
3
years
we
are
stuck
in
another
state
due
to
a
family
situation
the
drawbacks
we
see
to
maine
are
barriers
to
getting
medical
appts
not
too
many
if
any
direct
flights
for
people
to
visit
and
some
places
seem
to
have
a
lot
of
seasonal
stores
i
also
see
jobs
listed
as
an
issue
for
many
but
we
both
work
remotely
we
have
visited
2x
since
june
and
we
are
focused
on
southern
coastal
maine
we
are
both
healthcare
professionals
and
both
work
remotely
kids
will
all
be
in
college
when
we
move
so
it
will
just
be
the
2
of
us
we
both
grew
up
in
pennsylvania
and
know
about
snow
and
dark
any
thoughts
on
areas
we
have
some
ideas
areas
we
are
thinking
of
but
would
be
helpful
to
hear
insights
from
those
that
actually
live
there
we
have
quite
a
few
rescue
pups
so
dog
friendly
is
a
big
plus
and
also
getting
a
lot
that
is
at
least
25
acre
and
walkable
20
30
min
walk
to
the
beach
prefer
sandy
beaches
vs
rocky
ideally
not
a
huge
house
but
a
nice
size
lot
for
some
privacy
and
dogs
nice
or
at
least
neutral
neighbors
are
a
plus
progressive
area
a
big
plus
thanks
in
advance
howdy
everyone
i
m
going
to
be
moving
up
in
january
ish
to
portland
area
from
the
deep
south
i
m
originally
from
the
midwest
great
lakes
area
so
driving
in
all
kinds
of
winter
weather
isn
t
new
to
me
anyway
i
noticed
pods
for
moving
doesn
t
service
your
state
i
m
thinking
a
uhaul
that
time
of
year
probably
isn
t
worth
the
money
saved
and
it
s
probably
best
to
leave
it
to
the
professionals
any
one
have
any
general
tips
to
not
empty
my
savings
but
also
get
my
car
and
2
bedroom
apartment
worth
of
stuff
up
there
reliably
thank
you
in
advance
for
any
advice
hello
everyone
my
fianc
and
i
are
planning
on
going
to
maine
for
our
honeymoon
bar
harbor
and
acadia
and
then
kennebunkport
what
do
you
recommend
should
be
the
order
of
our
trip
for
a
week
trip
do
we
do
a
smaller
stint
in
bar
harbor
and
the
rest
in
kb
or
vice
versa
while
we
love
hiking
and
the
outdoors
we
also
enjoy
eating
and
drinking
and
relaxing
especially
on
the
honeymoon
lol
wondering
what
the
best
plan
would
be
this
will
be
in
late
july
i
have
the
opportunity
to
move
to
the
fort
kent
madawaska
area
how
easy
will
it
be
to
cross
the
border
to
edmunston
if
we
want
to
go
to
a
larger
town
for
shopping
yoga
class
seeing
a
movie
etc
i
am
unsure
of
the
small
town
life
but
edmunston
is
about
the
same
size
as
the
town
i
live
in
now
i
don
t
want
to
move
there
and
find
out
it
s
a
pain
to
cross
the
border
hi
so
i
got
a
job
in
maine
officially
now
and
would
need
to
move
in
sometime
mid
may
i
m
going
to
be
making
24
hr
to
start
i
have
no
connections
in
maine
so
i
d
likely
be
renting
alone
the
job
is
kind
of
far
from
portland
which
is
the
only
city
i
really
see
people
looking
for
roommates
in
my
question
is
are
there
housing
vouchers
if
i
m
looking
at
rentals
i
m
looking
at
a
studio
unit
in
biddeford
for
around
1
300
mo
but
that
s
at
the
absolute
top
of
my
budget
if
i
factor
in
overtime
pay
any
pointers
appreciated
removed
ill
be
visiting
portland
for
a
week
in
november
starting
the
10th
is
that
an
ok
time
to
visit
portland
and
where
should
i
stay
thats
close
to
downtown
but
cheap
looking
for
a
nice
lake
to
live
on
for
a
year
round
home
close
to
a
nice
town
like
belfast
i
wfm
and
my
husband
is
law
enforcement
so
has
his
pickings
for
places
to
work
any
recommendations
okay
redirecting
this
to
the
mega
thread
we
are
very
likely
moving
to
midcoast
maine
from
boston
this
fall
and
need
some
recommendations
on
what
towns
in
particular
to
check
out
my
husband
will
likely
be
working
in
walpole
south
bristol
and
we
would
like
to
live
a
bit
more
west
south
toward
portland
but
still
within
a
20
40
min
drive
for
him
i
like
having
a
bit
of
a
community
even
if
it
s
just
a
small
downtown
area
farmers
market
etc
decent
schools
are
a
plus
we
prefer
to
be
relatively
close
to
the
ocean
and
woods
which
isn
t
hard
to
come
by
in
midcoast
maine
we
ll
need
to
start
by
finding
a
rental
but
hope
to
buy
a
house
within
the
next
year
what
towns
should
we
explore
for
living
and
any
recommendations
on
the
best
place
to
look
for
rental
units
and
houses
for
sale
besides
the
obvious
zillow
realtor
sites
etc
hi
there
we
re
s
they
them
and
j
he
they
a
queer
neurodivergent
couple
in
our
early
20s
and
we
ve
been
together
for
8
years
this
october
we
re
currently
in
baltimore
but
we
re
looking
to
move
back
to
maine
where
we
first
met
in
high
school
and
have
always
felt
most
at
home
we
ve
been
vagrant
homeless
since
2020
but
we
re
ready
to
settle
down
put
down
roots
and
reconnect
with
the
place
we
miss
so
much
we
re
intellectual
and
creative
types
visual
artists
musicians
and
avid
readers
we
re
also
writers
always
working
on
something
new
we
thrive
in
calm
structured
environments
and
love
routine
we
ve
also
been
wilderness
instructors
and
camp
counselors
with
a
passion
for
working
with
kids
and
the
outdoors
hiking
and
backpacking
are
among
our
favorite
activities
and
we
enjoy
walking
everywhere
since
we
don
t
have
a
car
we
re
very
quiet
and
clean
and
we
usually
keep
to
ourselves
j
has
a
knack
for
cooking
and
baking
especially
since
he
has
food
allergies
soy
some
legumes
kiwis
so
everything
is
made
from
scratch
he
d
be
happy
to
share
some
of
his
culinary
creations
or
even
discuss
communal
meals
if
that
s
something
you
re
into
we
re
looking
for
a
chill
affordable
place
to
stay
we
don
t
drink
smoke
or
do
drugs
but
we
re
4
20
friendly
and
non
judgmental
as
long
as
everyone
s
comfortable
however
a
non
drinking
household
would
be
ideal
for
us
in
terms
of
work
j
is
pursuing
opportunities
in
administration
accounting
and
finance
and
he
s
also
an
experienced
specialty
barista
though
finding
work
that
accommodates
his
allergy
can
be
challenging
s
is
very
interested
in
management
leadership
and
teaching
we
don
t
have
jobs
lined
up
yet
but
we
re
actively
applying
and
are
optimistic
about
finding
work
soon
we
re
flexible
with
our
move
but
need
to
stay
in
baltimore
until
j
can
pick
up
his
glasses
which
should
be
ready
by
september
10th
if
you
know
of
any
rooms
shared
housing
or

helloooo
my
wife
and
i
no
kids
now
or
in
the
future
are
moving
to
maine
from
rhode
island
hopefully
before
winter
starts
my
in
laws
live
on
mt
desert
island
but
we
re
thinking
just
outside
portland
but
also
bangor
so
we
re
only
like
an
hour
from
them
i
know
portland
is
cool
but
how
is
bangor
especially
around
husson
university
do
we
need
to
worry
about
college
noise
or
whatever
our
goal
is
to
be
decently
private
with
an
acre
or
2
which
seems
not
out
of
the
realm
of
possibility
what
things
are
an
absolute
must
have
in
house
in
maine
hi
visiting
for
the
first
time
in
bar
harbor
until
tuesday
wondering
what
kind
of
bars
will
be
broadcasting
the
nfl
hoping
to
catch
some
games
if
i
can
i
know
they
re
closing
down
for
the
winter
here
so
feel
free
to
mention
places
that
would
typically
show
games
i
can
do
the
legwork
to
call
and
make
sure
they
re
open
thanks
deleted
hi
there
not
to
count
my
chickens
before
they
hatch
but
the
person
i
can
see
myself
building
my
life
with
and
i
would
like
to
move
up
to
maine
to
live
the
rest
of
our
lives
we
re
both
early
20s
they
re
going
into
systems
information
and
i
m
going
into
law
best
thing
i
can
do
with
my
history
education
so
best
case
scenario
we
d
be
making
livable
money
we
re
both
florida
natives
cant
stand
the
heat
i
m
wondering
if
its
worth
it
i
guess
i
m
really
paranoid
about
climate
change
and
i
m
afraid
by
the
time
i
move
up
to
maine
itll
be
just
as
hot
and
miserable
as
florida
or
i
wont
see
any
snow
maybe
just
paranoia
i
guess
would
there
be
employment
opportunities
for
either
of
us
as
in
how
goods
the
job
market
for
either
of
our
professions
i
d
be
just
as
happy
to
live
in
a
rural
area
as
an
urban
one
as
i
love
nature
especially
forests
in
the
autumn
additionally
i
d
wonder
if
we
d
be
welcome
i
know
of
a
few
cities
and
even
states
that
go
by
the
motto
buzz
off
were
full
and
i
dont
wanna
be
viewed
as
some
sort
of
gentrifier
or
something
of
the
sort
additionally
were
both
southeners
not
hateful
hicks
but
just
plain
southern
mannerisms
and
as
i
understand
it
theres
a
bit
of
a
dialect
and
mannerism
gap
people
in
maine
speak
differently
tend
to
compliment
differently
may
be
sharper
with
their
tongues
although
that
may
just
be
the
way
my
father
views
y
all
anyways
i
ll
tl
dr
it
do
you
think
maine
will
be
so
hot
and
miserable
within
the
next
5
years
there
wont
be
snow
do
you
think
there
would
be
employment
for
a
lawyer
or
a
systems
information
type
in
any
sort
of
area
would
we
be
viewed
as
unwelcome
outsiders
encroaching
on
established
communities
sorry
for
the
huge
blogpost
and
the
naive
questions
but
i
ve
only
ever
traveled
farther
than
georgia
maybe
3
times
in
my
life
i
can
think
of
so
i
m
out
of
the
loop
hi
y
all
my
dad
stepmom
live
in
maine
and
my
husband
and
i
are
looking
to
make
the
move
we
want
to
be
settled
within
the
next
18
months
max
but
now
we
re
looking
at
moving
up
that
timeline
i
think
we
are
wanting
to
rent
for
our
first
year
or
so
and
our
main
concern
is
being
near
a
daycare
k
8
school
we
both
work
remotely
and
our
jobs
can
transfer
my
questions
kind
mainers
are
when
would
you
start
looking
for
a
rental
i
know
where
i
am
there
is
no
point
unless
you
re
within
60
days
of
move
in
is
that
about
what
i
should
expect
there
or
should
i
start
to
inquire
look
earlier
any
specific
areas
you
d
recommend
either
pro
or
to
avoid
for
a
family
with
young
kids
my
dad
said
sanford
to
avoid
due
to
high
taxes
he
s
also
80
so
i
d
love
any
additional
input

portland

town
especially
if
there
are
community
events
to
get
involved
in
our
current
school
district
is
literally
the
second
worst
in
the
us
so
any
me
school
district
is
probably
better
lol
we
d
love
to
have
a
property
where
we
could
have
a
small
garden
and
some
chickens
we
d
be
moving
from
outside
of
las
vegas
husband
s
and
my
hometown
but
we
previously
lived
in
boston
and
providence
for
12
years
and
loved
it
we
traveled
to
maine
many
times
when
we
lived
in
new
england
we
are
left
leaning
and
i
m
queer
so
we
d
like
to
end
up
in
a
town
where
that
s
not
an
issue
i
m
not
saying
every
house
and
business
needs
to
fly
a
rainbow
flag
but
i
d
love
to
not
have
our
rainbow
flag
stolen
you
might
want
to
make
a
main
page
post
about
this
get
more
visibility
that
way
good
luck
this
need
to
save
our
mods
on
the
face
of
it
it
would
appear
that
portland
is
much
more
affordable
than
major
cities
however
professional
career
opportunities
are
very
limited
outside
of
law
and
medicine
a
lot
of
employers
in
the
area
are
behind
national
averages
on
compensation
as
well
i
m
a
mechanical
engineer
with
6
yoe
in
the
area
and
i
m
at
90k
which
is
a
bit
behind
where
it
probably
should
be
but
switching
jobs
is
challenging
because
i
ve
already
interviewed
at
most
of
the
local
employers
in
the
past
8
years
residential
architecture
seems
to
be
pretty
saturated
with
late
career
professionals
there
are
a
lot
of
wealthy
summer
people
who
want
that
magazine
renovation
of
their
summer
cottage
commercial
architecture
seems
to
have
some
opportunities
around
here
i
interviewed
for
internships
at
most
of
the
commercial
architecture
firms
in
the
area
but
never
heard
back
i
have
a
hunch
they
went
with
nepo
hires
which
is
extremely
common
around
here
i
have
no
idea
how
their
compensation
is
i
have
little
to
no
visibility
into
the
it
landscape
there
seems
to
be
a
trend
towards
outsourcing
our
it
dept
got
outsourced
to
a
local
company
called
systems
engineering
when
we
went
to
the
azure
cloud
finally
i
personally
wouldn
t
uproot
my
life
to
move
to
fucking
gorham
it
s
such
a
nothing
town
it
s
only
selling
point
is
proximity
to
portland
for
commuters
if
you
do
move
here
at
least
pick
someplace
that
is
somewhat
interesting
or
out
of
the
ordinary
based
on
what
you
wrote
you
would
hate
it
here
i
d
strongly
suggest
against
it
knox
county
resident
here
where
warren
is
its
easier
to
find
shorter
term
rentals
in
the
winter
people
that
rent
places
short
term
get
may
october
but
the
season
ends
and
most
places
just
close
up
maine
state
prison
in
warren
is
the
largest
in
the
state
has
approx
1000
inmates
you
might
want
to
ask
around
on
facebook
which
is
where
there
s
a
more
local
presence
for
things
like
this
there
s
midcoast
message
board
and
midcoast
message
board
2
some
sort
of
drama
led
to
a
second
one
being
started
can
t
remember
what
it
was
also
what
s
up
in
warren
page
they
may
post
for
you
if
you
ask
nicely
the
colors
will
be
a
little
muted
by
then
it
will
be
unimpressive
to
us
but
probably
more
then
enough
for
you
unless
we
get
a
big
wind
and
rain
storm
in
the
next
couple
weeks
then
the
leaves
will
mostly
be
gone
1
its
hyper
local
as
to
where
and
when
leaves
peak
also
tree
species
dependent
some
areas
you
will
drive
through
will
still
look
good
some
might
not
look
as
great
2
past
peak
means
just
that
there
will
still
be
color
and
leaves
just
not
as
many
as
before
you
will
be
fine
it
will
still
be
pretty
and
most
likely
not
100
s
in
this
world
still
nice
weather
if
a
bit
chilly
at
night
past
peak
is
really
subjective
i
personally
prefer
past
peak
as
even
though
some
leaves
have
fallen
and
some
branches
are
bare
the
leaves
that
are
still
on
the
trees
are
all
more
colorful
and
there
s
more
of
a
contrast
than
during
so
called
peak
you
ll
still
see
plenty
of
pretty
leaves
and
it
doesn
t
matter
if
it
s
cloudy
or
sunny
they
ll
still
be
beautiful
i
just
drove
through
eastern
vt
and
western
nh
and
they
are
about
peek
you
are
going
to
be
a
little
late
i
believe
peek
foliage
is
happening
about
right
now
for
the
mountains
all
the
reds
orange
yellows
will
be
gone
you
will
have
brown
or
just
evergreens
to
mostly
look
at
when
you
arrive
if
night
life
a
metal
scene
and
meeting
other
young
people
are
priorities
the
greater
portland
area
is
really
the
only
place
that
will
get
you
any
of
that
somewhere
like
brunswick
might
work
for
you
if
you
can
find
an
apartment
in
your
price
range
that
will
put
you
within
okay
commuting
distance
to
augusta
while
still
accessible
to
portland
for
events
down
there
hallowell
the
cool
part
of
the
augusta
area
has
two
bars
that
are
open
late
and
unless
there
s
a
band
playing
they
re
both
often
pretty
quiet
there
aren
t
many
young
people
here
and
most
of
them
don
t
go
out
much
i
m
tired
of
this
area
at
age
30
i
can
t
imagine
moving
here
at
23
without
knowing
anybody
fyi
maine
doesn
t
have
as
bad
of
darkness
winters
but
it
is
also
a
very
common
mental
health
issue
during
winter
we
have
plenty
of
morning
commute
in
darkness
and
evening
commutes
in
darkness
for
months
during
winter
the
cold
winters
for
harbor
towns
will
also
be
the
ones
more
effected
by
this
being
more
north
east
than
the
other
parts
of
the
state
southern
maine
has
extremely
mild
winters
now
thanks
to
climate
crisis
good
luck
in
your
decision
check
out
the
nice
people
at
www
boots2roots
org
they
are
a
maine
ngo
that
assists
veterans
looking
to
move
to
maine
they
might
have
some
insights
for
you
for
sure
i
know
its
not
alaska
dark
but
due
to
maine
s
position
in
the
eastern
time
zone
it
does
get
darker
earlier
here
than
in
other
places
i
know
its
the
same
amount
of
sun
as
other
places
on
similar
latitude
but
getting
dark
at
4
00
pm
in
december
can
be
a
bit
of
a
bummer
to
some
people
as
for
the
aviation
mechanic
angle
there
s
smaller
airports
aside
from
pwm
and
bgr
in
brunswick
bar
harbor
and
owls
head
the
latter
two
have
commercial
flights
might
be
more
employment
opportunities
in
those
areas
worth
looking
into
anyways
honestly
anywhere
along
the
maine
coast
sounds
like
it
would
fit
your
bill
i
d
really
look
at
towns
on
the
coast
between
rockland
and
winter
harbor
that
includes
the
towns
that
to
go
up
the
penobscot
river
up
to
bangor
on
both
banks
and
of
course
the
island
towns
on
mount
desert
island
deer
isle
etc
id
take
a
really
good
look
at
belfast
personally
it
s
a
great
progressive
maine
town
that
doesn
t
get
hit
with
quite
as
much
tourist
traffic
as
some
of
the
other
coastal
harbour
towns
it
s
a
county
seat
and
in
my
humble
opinion
represents
me
pretty
well
i
can
speak
to
isle
au
haut
you
can
book
a
round
trip
ticket
for
the
mailboat
in
season
a
great
way
to
see
the
island
is
take
a
morning
ferry
out
and
get
off
at
duck
harbor
then
walk
the
4
miles
back
to
town
its
not
really
a
town
to
the
main
dock
the
boat
will
pick
you
up
there
there
s
plenty
of
time
if
you
can
walk
at
a
regular
pace
of
a
couple
miles
an
hour
you
can
also
see
monhegan
that
takes
you
out
and
you
have
several
hours
to
walk
around
the
island
and
hang
out
get
lunch
there
s
a
brewery
good
hiking
i
can
speak
to
vinalhaven
not
walkable
if
you
want
to
see
the
sites
you
can
probably
rent
bikes
which
would
be
fine
for
a
day
trip
definitely
need
a
car
if
you
really
want
to
explore
the
island
for
your
second
question
if
you
left
rockland
on
the
first
boat
and
returned
on
the
last
you
would
have
time
to
ride
to
lane
s
island
and
get
lunch
vinal
haven
and
north
haven
have
small
downtown
areas
like
a
few
shops
restaurants
inns
right
next
to
the
ferry
so
if
you
just
want
to
go
for
the
afternoon
you
ll
be
fine
these
are
massive
islands
but
the
best
way
to
get
around
is
by
bike
you
can
cover
a
lot
of
ground
to
get
to
different
state
parks
hiking
trails
and
other
things
to
check
out
pretty
sure
you
can
find
somewhere
renting
bikes
right
near
the
ferry
isle
au
huat
and
swans
are
a
lot
less
developed
around
the
ferry
area
so
you
ll
probably
need
to
bring
a
bike
on
the
ferry
then
you
have
monhegan
which
is
small
enough
where
you
can
walk
the
entire
length
within
45
minutes
how
much
are
primary
school
and
secondary
school
fees
in
the
state
is
it
difficult
to
ballot
for
spaces
as
a
new
resident
public
schools
are
free
in
the
us
all
resident
children
are
automatically
eligible
for
their
local
school
i
have
seen
the
tax
calculators
for
federal
and
state
what
do
the
local
taxes
look
like
they
are
dependent
on
the
value
of
the
house
if
you
own
a
house
you
also
pay
a
local
sales
tax
of
i
think
5
5
on
all
purchases
which
is
added
on
top
of
advertised
prices
unlike
a
vat
already
incorporated
into
store
prices
in
other
countries
you
will
also
pay
excise
tax
to
register
vehicles
which
varies
from
town
to
town
plus
bmv
registration
fees
how
much
do
utilities
run
on
average
for
a
house
between
1
000
and
2
000
sqft
i
ve
never
had
a
heater
and
there
seems
to
be
a
mix
of
sources
like
gas
oil
electric
and
wood
completely
depends
on
the
source
i
ve
seen
1200
sqft
houses
that
are
warm
and
toasty
with
just
a
wood
stove
and
1200
sqft
houses
with
electric
baseboard
that
has
to
run
all
the
time
hard
to
say
but
generally
figure
a
few
thousand
dollars
per
winter
for
sure
minimum
and
can
go
up
from
there
if
you
have
a
drafty
house
with
electric
only
heaters
electricity
is
expensive
in
maine
are
there
any
specific
features
to
look
out
for
when
buying
a
home
related
to
the
client
look
at
the
heating
also
if
there
is
a
very
long
driveway
you
will
have
to
pay
someone
to
plow
the
snow
when
it
comes
that
can
add
up
if
its
a
snowy
winter
are
there
any
other
hitches
or
gotchas
because
maine
seems
pretty
dope
on
paper
we
don
t
live
on
paper
there
s
a
lot
to
love
about
maine
but
there
are
challenges
its
cold
6
months
of
the
year
but
most
get
used
to
it
hard
to
find
decent
fresh
fruit
in
the
winter
same
for
good
vegetables
it
gets
dark
quite
early
for
much
of
the
year
like
4pm
in
january
february
its
very
rural
in
most
places
you
do
a
lot
of
driving
outside
of
portland
there
s
not
a
lot
of
walkable
towns
and
travel
out
of
the
state
via
plane
takes
an
extra
flight
to
new
york
dc
or
philadelphia
unless
you
drive
down
to
boston
to
fly
can
you
expand
on
your
first
question
alittle
are
you
looking
to
send
your
kids
to
a
private
school
ballot
for
new
spaces
doesn
t
really
make
sense
local
property
taxes
are
going
to
vary
wildly
depending
on
the
town
and
the
property
you
buy
generally
on
the
coast
you
are
going
to
be
looking
at
4k
12
a
year
again
massive
difference
house
to
house
depending
on
age
heating
system
and
well
insulated
it
is
but
3k
5k
is
a
conservative
estimate
electricity
is
expensive
here
with
3
kids
you
re
property
going
to
be
paying
100
250
a
month
also
if
you
re
living
rural
you
will
need
a
backup
electricity
source
not
really
anything
state
wide
just
hire
a
inspector
before
you
purchase
where
have
you
lived
before
because
it
sounds
like
you
have
never
experienced
a
winter
before
the
coast
is
much
milder
the
inland
and
the
winter
s
are
not
nearly
as
bad
when
you
visit
travel
inland
towards
bethel
rangeley
or
greenville
where
it
will
be
colder
and
snowier
edit
fixed
typo
the
maine
wildlife
park
https
www
maine
gov
ifw
wildlife
park
in
gray
is
exactly
what
you
re
looking
for
r
mainegonewild
hello
there
as
someone
who
also
move
to
maine
from
tennessee
with
a
year
pit
stop
in
ohio
i
totally
understand
what
you
mean
by
the
summers
i
think
your
biggest
concerns
are
going
to
be
price
of
living
where
you
live
in
maine
is
going
to
be
dictated
mostly
by
what
you
can
afford
working
remote
really
helps
in
those
regards
if
you
have
to
rent
it
will
be
exceedingly
difficult
up
here
to
find
something
affordable
that
also
takes
multiple
pets
winter
look
i
m
not
as
concerned
with
it
as
most
i
think
the
biggest
hurdle
for
people
from
the
south
to
clear
isn
t
the
omg
snow
and
ice
and
ahhh
but
the
length
of
it
it
s
cold
and
it
s
cold
for
a
long
time
and
you
will
lose
power
and
if
you
don
t
have
a
generator
or
a
really
good
heat
source
you
will
be
cold
when
you
re
cold
and
you
re
cold
it
s
something
that
can
be
tolerated
but
i
just
want
to
set
an
expectation
finally
access
to
health
care
i
see
you
have
ms
and
i
think
it
s
important
that
prioritize
how
near
you
are
to
health
care
it
d
nice
to
just
find
some
place
off
in
the
county
you
ll
find
out
and
live
out
the
rural
maine
dream
but
you
ll
probably
have
to
commute
down
to
bangor
for
any
serious
health
care
needs
and
possibly
just
for
primary
care
as
such
i
wouldn
t
go
too
much
further
north
than
bangor
good
luck
friend
come
visit
in
january
february
to
get
a
true
feel
for
how
winters
wll
be
lyme
disease
isn
t
a
big
deal
anywhere
super
treatable
early
on
ticks
are
getting
worse
each
year
because
of
warning
climate
still
lyme
is
the
least
of
my
worries
with
ticks
look
up
all
the
other
stuff
they
spread
if
you
truly
are
fine
with
the
outdoors
and
do
not
need
amenities
found
in
major
cities
it
may
be
worth
serious
consideration
however
housing
is
an
issue
statewide
except
some
of
the
super
duper
rural
areas
do
plenty
of
research
on
different
areas
northern
maine
has
what
you
re
looking
for
still
affordable
homes
in
aroostook
county
visit
during
winter
and
any
other
season
you
can
to
get
a
better
feel
for
whather
it
s
for
you
head
over
to
acadia
in
the
morning
do
the
park
loop
drive
maybe
a
walk
around
jordan
pond
thunder
hole
etc
see
if
you
can
get
reservations
to
drive
up
cadillac
mountain
ahead
of
time
for
the
view
not
a
bad
way
to
start
if
you
get
there
early
in
the
morning
the
drive
from
bar
harbor
to
camden
is
roughly
100
120
minutes
depending
on
your
desire
to
stop
for
lobsters
roughly
halfway
you
can
t
go
wrong
with
youngs
lobster
pound
in
belfast
its
basic
picnic
tables
outside
on
a
nice
day
upstairs
inside
on
a
rainy
cold
day
you
can
bring
your
own
beer
wine
if
you
want
that
they
don
t
sell
it
there
belfast
has
a
nice
small
downtown
to
walk
around
a
bit
and
then
its
not
far
to
camden
from
there
if
you
are
enjoying
the
drive
and
want
to
see
some
windy
backroads
and
little
towns
take
route
3
west
out
of
belfast
for
a
few
miles
then
turn
on
131
towards
searsmont
at
belmont
corner
turn
left
on
173
towards
and
through
lincolnville
center
then
52
down
to
camden
adds
about
10
15
minutes
of
driving
but
is
pretty
especially
with
the
leaves
turning
in
camden
see
if
lucky
betty
s
is
open
its
a
great
very
very
casual
bar
long
grain
mosaic
and
cafe
louis
are
all
great
dinner
options
if
open
natalie
s
for
fine
dining
and
waterfront
restaurant
is
good
as
well
camden
breakfast
at
buttermilk
kitchen
if
you
like
that
sort
of
thing
or
you
can
go
into
rockland
and
go
to
either
rock
city
coffee
or
atlantic
baking
company
for
pastries
espresso
drinks
coffees
walk
around
downtown
that
s
about
it
for
rockland
unless
you
want
to
hang
out
until
the
farnsworth
museum
is
open
if
you
are
art
lovers
not
a
bad
idea
if
weather
is
crappy
take
route
1
down
damariscotta
is
great
for
a
short
walk
around
downtown
not
much
to
see
in
boothbay
this
time
of
year
wiscasset
can
be
done
in
10
minutes
but
bath
and
brunswick
have
more
going
on
for
sure
freeport
has
the
ll
bean
flagship
store
good
to
see
and
good
outlet
shopping
in
town
that
s
about
it
mast
landing
and
maine
beer
co
breweries
are
there
if
you
like
breweries
both
are
excellent
you
will
definitely
want
to
take
route
1
down
all
the
way
to
brunswick
then
shift
to
295
for
the
few
minutes
to
freeport
from
there
295
to
portland
from
there
on
the
way
back
up
to
canada
take
95
not
much
is
open
in
old
orchard
beach
this
time
of
the
year
you
can
walk
the
beach
which
will
still
be
nice
go
to
biddeford
saco
next
door
check
out
the
small
mills
museum
see
the
waterfall
and
short
riverwalk
check
showtimes
at
city
theatre
or
just
eat
at
some
of
the
award
winning
restaurants
like
fika
palace
diner
or
fish
whistle
lots
of
breweries
if
that
s
your
jam
just
walk
around
agree
with
walk
around
if
you
are
talking
about
the
train
in
portland
you
can
walk
along
the
ocean
on
the
eastern
prom
trail
next
to
it
for
it
s
0
5
1
mile
length
molly
haley
or
leslie
swan
no
one
goes
to
a
restaurant
to
eat
this
stuff
it
d
be
like
asking
for
a
restaurant
that
serves
frozen
pizza
or
hamburger
helper
sorry
for
the
late
notice
but
you
can
find
tourterie
by
mailhot
s
labeled
as
meat
pie
in
many
grocery
stores
just
don
t
look
at
the
nutrition
facts
probably
not
going
to
find
any
of
those
in
restaurants
outside
of
diners
in
lewiston
auburn
and
that
s
a
big
maybe
maine
diner
in
wells
sometimes
has
it
go
hiking
at
any
of
the
nearby
trails
google
and
enjoy
the
end
of
foliage
with
brisk
temps
lots
of
places
to
eat
too
in
camden
and
beyond
rockland
belfast
you
also
can
t
go
wrong
just
driving
around
enjoying
the
view
and
finding
things
to
explore
it
s
post
peak
season
but
it
s
not
winter
yet
so
there
s
still
stuff
happening
and
yeah
the
boats
go
to
sleep
in
october
both
because
of
the
unpredictable
weather
lower
temps
and
the
fact
a
lot
of
the

is
seasonal
and
has
moved
on
until

there
also
just
aren

the

no

since

with

i

it
s
probably
maybe
you
can
order

banks
its
all

great
thing
about
so
many

is
financial
institutions
all
are
pretty
much
the
exact
same
now
if
you
need
physical
locations
then
find
one
that
will
be
best
for
you
personally
i
have
usaa
which
has
no
branches
and
i
am
fine
in
this
digital
world
work
with
the
bank
that
is
best
for
you
most
of
the
credit
unions
up
here
are
good
to
go
and
networked
pick
whatever
has
the
best
incentives
for
you
it
s
an
affluent
area
by
maine
standards
so
you
have
a

of
choices
a

of
people
with
second

as
well
as
locals
maintain
local
accounts
at

all
of

at

is
really
good
the
two
museums
on

are
worth
checking
out
and
library
usually
has
some
interesting
exhibits
wild
oats
would
be
good
for
lunch
too
or
maybe
breakfast
that
s
over
on
the
old
navy
base
i
think
if
i
had
a
day
in
brunswick
i
would
have
breakfast
at
wild
oats
drive
out
to
harpswell
and
see
the
giant
s
stairs
check
out
bowdoin
and
have
lunch
then
either
drive
or
walk
into
brunswick
and
walk
around
and
have
dinner
if
you
re
up
to
it
you
can
walk
the
swinging
bridge
into
topsham
and
then
go
over
to
the
green
bridge
and
walk
back
into
brunswick
you
might
want
to
do
bath
instead
of
harpswell
mae
s
is
good
for

in

where
s
here
pretty
substantial
difference
between
north

inland
it
might

it
may

what
s
the

depends
on

will
be

different

that
s
really
about

the
botanical

then
that

isn

worth
a

while
i
personally
have
not

i
have
been
told
it
fills
out
quickly
this
is
a
question
that
doesn
t
need
to
be
in
the
visitors
moving

thread
i
think
you
d
get
better
response
if
you
put
it
in
the
regular

you
re
not
missing
anything
you
could
broaden
your
search
a
bit
with
craigslist
and
fbook
but
there
s
still
not
much
available
could
try
zillow
and
the
other
real
is
state
sites
they
have
apartments
and
rentals
listed
as
well
gotta
sort
of
just
pick
an

i
think
you

going
to

pretty
limited
by
your
price
range
and
available
inventory
especially
if
you
want
to
be
near
the
coast
you
re
likely
going
to
have
to
find
a
home
you
like
can
afford
and
move
there
rather
than
find
an
area
you
like
and
buy
a
home
there
if
you
get
what
i
m
saying
niche
hobbies
like
table
top
games
really
only
restrict
you

i
m
not

what
the

currently
is
check
out
their

there
s
sometimes
pick
up
indoor
soccer
at
the

at

too
but
i
don

know
if
that
s
a

thing
or
if
it
s
true

coastal
route
is
going

dream
shoot

off

and
you
will
find
a
spot
wolfe
s
neck
state
park
in
freeport
is
gorgeous
bradbury
mountain
in
pownal
is
not
far
and
has
a
beautiful
view
from
the
top
i
also
love
the
scenery
in
harpswell
the
giant
s
stairs
and
pott
s
point
especially
i
ve
been
in
augusta
for
the
past
3
years
and
it
s
not
exactly
what
you
think
it
is
walking
to
work
this
is
possible
if
you
find
a
job
and
housing
right
in
the
downtown
core
but
not
realistic
otherwise
most
of
the
roads
are
really
not
bike
friendly
or
really
pedestrian
friendly
for
that
matter
especially
in
rush
hour
traffic
so
i
wouldn
t
plan
on
that
the
housing
is
in
bad
shape
especially
what
you
can
reasonably
afford
i
pay
1000
month
for
an
attic
apartment
that
leaks
when
it
rains
and
gets
to
90
degrees
in
the
summer
and
i
haven
t
left
because
everything
else
has
gotten
even
more
overpriced
as
for
a
social
life
if
you
don
t
already
know
people
in
the
area
it
will
be
a
huge
challenge
there
aren
t
many
places
for
people
to
go
to
hang
out
and
even
then
people
around
here
just
don
t
seem
to
go
out
in
general
as
for
outdoorsy
things
this
isn
t
a
bad
place
for
that
there
are
some
good
mountain
bike
trails
in
town
and
we
re
only
1
2
hours
from
great
skiing
and
hiking
i
live
in
that
general
area
just
south
of
gardiner
and
it
s
not
bad
i
find
it
a
little
boring
though
since
i
love
doing
outdoor
stuff
it
is
very
affordable
compared
to
portland
which
is
why
i
am
here
i
m
getting
paid
about
the
same
as
i
would
in
portland
so
the
income
arbitrage
is
100
worth
it
i
get
the
sense
that
is
why
most
people
my
age
range
28
35
that
moved
here
are
here
augusta
itself
is
really
only
good
for
box
store
shopping
and
possibly
work
hallowell
has
historically
been
the
place
to
hang
out
but
gardiner
is
coming
into
it
s
own
slowly
but
surely
i
ve
seen
some
hipsters
down
there
these
past
few
years
with
the
local
crowd
it
s
an
interesting
contrast
people
around
here
are
friendly
but
insular
i
had
the
easiest
time
making
friends
in
bangor
that
was
probably
more
a
function
of
the
fact
i
grew
up
closeish
to
there
and
can
relate
to
the
people
very
easily
i
had
a
hard
time
relating
to
portlanders
but
through
work
i
was
mainly
exposed
to
the
elite
suburbanites
of
portland
and
i
was
in
my
early
20s
the
augusta
area
generally
is
close
enough
to
piscataquis
and
somerset
counties
where
you
can
easily
access
decent
hiking
exceptional
kayaking
canoeing
exceptional
fishing
etc
it
s
the
best
base
in
maine
for
downhill
skiing
no
question
the
only
city
area
of
maine
that
i
think
is
better
for
outdoor
rec
access
is
bangor
for
it
s
proximity
to
baxter
and
the
fact
it
s
way
closer
to
the
moosehead
100
mile
wilderness
down
east
lakes
etc
bangor
also
has
an
established
mtb
scene
with
good
trails
at
the
city
forest
and
umaine
many
people
say
portland
is
best
for
outdoor
rec
i
ve
found
that
is
really
only
true
if
you
love
the
whites
and
boating
or
ocean
fishing
almost
all
of
my
coworkers
when
i
lived
there
drove
3
hours
to
sugarloaf
every
single
weekend
anyways
it
s
nice
but
really
quiet
i
moved
here
4
or
so
months
ago
and
the
only
people
i
really
know
are
my
coworkers
but
that
might
be
on
me
as
for
expenses
i
m
paying
almost
as
much
for
a
one
bedroom
as
i
did
in
southern
california
which
is
insane
it
was
one
of
the
cheaper
places
i
could
find
in
rental
sites
that
weren
t
scams
and
i
still
had
to
pick
somewhere
20
mins
outside
of
augusta
however
everything
else
here
costs
less
than
the
west
coast
if
you
figure
out
how
to
meet
people
as
an
early
30s
outdoorsy
person
let
me
know
also
are
there
subgroups
for
maine
mountain
biking
maine
skiing
maine
kayaking
etc
i
havent
been
able
to
find
them
median
home
price
in
york
county
was
520k
this
summer
i
don
t
think
it
s
gone
down
since
then
maine
is
a
decent
place
to
grow
up
not
a
ton
of
diversity
not
a
ton
of
cultural
experiences
but
its
safe
with
ready
access
to
outdoor
activities
there
s
always
the
chance
that
you
could
encounter
a
random
crazy
person
but
i
wouldn
t
worry
about
being
hassled
for
being
a
federal
employee
maine
is
a
great
place
to
grow
up
for
a
kid
i
left
as
soon
as
i
could
after
school
but
i
won
t
deny
it
was
a
much
better
childhood
than
what
s
normal
today
nobody
is
going
to
care
about
what
your
job
is
in
york
county
other
than
a
few
crazies
people
are
big
on
minding
your
own
damn
business
compared
to
other
states
maine
is
way
more
expensive
than
it
should
be
so
your
95k
post
tax
is
going
to
be
tight
if
your
partner
isn
t
working
if
you
re
going
to
be
buying
a
house
you
should
have
a
solid
savings
for
a
down
payment
or
the
proceeds
from
a
sale
elsewhere
you
will
find
energy
costs
to
be
outrageous
maine
is
a
unique
culture
that
s
not
a
bad
thing
but
if
you
re
from
mainstream
america
it
s
going
to
take
a
little
while
to
figure
it
out
people
will
seem
aloof
but
they
re
honestly
more
genuinely
kind
than
outwardly
friendly
people
are
elsewhere
no
one
cares
if
you
re
a
federal
employee
and
the
fact
that
you
had
to
ask
is
a
reminder
that
we
are
fortunate
to
live
in
maine
depends
on
what
part
of
the
midwest
you
re
from
if
you
don
t
have
winter
clothing
now
you
can
always
get
some
once
you
re
here
if
you
re
going
to
be
out
and
about
or
driving
at
all
yes
you
should
have
winter
clothing
including
good
gloves
mittens
there
s
some
pretty
good
hiking
an
hour
north
of
you
indoor
ice
rink
and
a
small
movie
theater
not
a
ton
else
to
do
if
you
re
only
going
to
be
here
for
three
months
probably
not
worth
it
to
buy
a
snowmobile
or
ice
fishing
traps
dover
gets
more
snow
than
a
good
chunk
of
the
state
and
will
usually
have
at
least
a
couple
weeks
in
the
single
digit
temperatures
so
i
d
buy
a
coat
and
boots
i

you

very
bad
here
just
like
most
places
months
and
months
to
get
established
with
a
new
primary
specialty
areas
are
backed
up
months
and
expect
long
wait
times
for
just
scheduling
for
most

housing
is
barren
in
metro
areas
brunswick
included
expect
to
pay
more

the
closer
to
higher

and
i

higher
than

there
s

not
a

better
if

good
luck
with
everything
i
feel
like
that
can
mean
a
couple
things
i
ve
lived
in
new
england
90
of
my
life
and
it
typically
either
means
1
slow
down
danger
ahead
could
be
cops
could
be
a
moose
could
be
an
accident
2
you
re
doing
something
wrong
like
having
your
lights
off
at
night
or
your
high
beams
are
on
typically
i
don
t
flash
my
lights
unless
it
s
a
warning
to
slow
down
it
means
your
headlights
are
angled
incorrectly
and
you
re
blinding
the
other
driver
or
your
brights
are
left
on
warning
just
be
prepared
for
the
possibility
of
being
snowed
in
at
some
time
and
not
being
able
to
do
anything
for
a
day
or
two
along
the
coast
is
more
likely
to
be
better
weather
but
its
not
guaranteed
if
you
don
t
want
fancy
handbags
stay
out
of
coastal
southern
maine
and
you
will
be
fine
bar
harbor
will
be
pretty
shut
down
in
february
but
i
guess
you
could
go
see
acadia
again
weather
permitting
don
t
plan
on
much
hiking
but
if
its
open
you
could
do
the
park
loop
i
guess
i
would
second
bangor
as
a
decent
hub
if
you
get
snowed
in
at
least
there
s
a
few
places
to
go
out
to
eat
drink
state
of
maine
tourism
has
a
site
that
should
help
https
visitmaine
com
rangeley
for
mountains
ice
fishing
and
bar
harbor
for
acadia
coast
neither
of
those
places
are
what
i
d
call
salt
of
the
earth
unless
you
re
really
talking
down
to
us
but
that
s
to
some
degree
mutually
exclusive
with
the
touristy
stuff
you
want
to
do
fly
into
bangor
stay
there
and
rent
a
car
from
the
airport
that
is
a
plenty
good
home
base
for
all
of
those
things
1
it
s
going
to
be
very
weather
dependent
in
november
also
the
hiking
in
the
white
mountains
is
going
to
be
very
different
the
acadia
much
steeper
and
more
difficult
plus
it
will
be
past
the
peak
foliage
season
2
boothbay
is
one
word
the
botanical
gardens
are
nice
but
not
so
much
in
november
other
than
the
gardens
boothbay
isn
t
worth
it
3
any
apple
orchard
on
in
november
is
only
going
to
have
apples
to
buy
not
pick
your
own
4
no
you
picked
probably
the
worst
time
to
visit
pick
up
downeast
or
yankee
magazine
for
restaurant
recommendations
if
you
want
to
now
how
locals
live
in
november
bring
a
book
pick
up
some
local
beer
and
enjoy
the
rain
https
visitmaine
com
the
botanical
gardens
in
boothbay
closes
in
october
so
you
won
t
be
able
to
visit
then
have
you
been
to
bath
it
s
such
a
cute
little
town
they
have
a
winter
farmer
s
market
nice
shops
the
maritime
museum
and
thorne
head
preserve
has
great
hiking
i
bet
the
views
are
even
better
in
november
it
s
near
harpswell
which
is
gorgeous
all
year
check
out
visitbath
com
and
the
harpswell
heritage
land
trust
website
the
mountains
are
bigger
closer
to
new
hampshire
and
in
late
fall
it
will
be
less
crowded
and
probably
not
too
icy
a
lot
will
be
closed
in
boothbay
and
boothbay
harbor
they
are
two
different
towns
and
same
with
peaks
although
a
walk
around
the
island
is
always
lovely
regardless
of
the
weather
this
time
of
year
is
great
because
it
s
less
busy
easier
to
park
and
easier
to
get
dinner
reservations
sure
some
things
will
be
closed
but
it
sounds
like
you
re
back
often
enough
to
make
time
for
those
things
congrats
on
your
upcoming
wedding
do
you
like
the
sun
if
so
too
bad
you
only
get
three
months
of
sun
and
very
dark
cold
winter
days
where
you
almost
never
see
the
sun
seasonal
depression
is
a
huge
thing
here
cost
of
living
has
gone
up
a
ton
since
covid
houses
may
be
affordable
but
that
doesn
t
mean
everything
else
is
we
have
the
worst
not
anecdotal
electric
infrastructure
and
you
will
have
power
outages
anywhere
outside
of
metro
areas
high
speed
is
a
toss
up
if
there
s
fiber
great
you
may
only
get
cable
which
is
acceptable
high
speeds
but
only
one
supplier
has
a
monopoly
on
the
whole
state
pretty
much
which
is
spectrum
and
shitty
company
all
around
that
price
gouges
cars
get
rusty
quick
if
you
commute
at
all
we
salt
the
fuck
out
of
our
roads
speaking
of
they
are
always
needing
repairs
we
are
a
big
state
with
tons
of
rural
folk
living
and
the
roads
are
always
being
repaved
cause
of
the
salt
we
use
each
winter
plows
just
tear
them
up
each
year
health
care
is
tough
if
you
need
any
specialty
and
expect
several
months
waiting
just
for
referrals
many
primary
care
are
on
wait
list
for
new
patients
think
that
s
a
good
start
good
luck
finding
something
to
rent
spend
a
week
up
here
in
january
to
see
if
it
really
is
something
you
d
consider
dark
so
dark
housing
is
tough
here
you
probably
got
downvoted
for
assuming
houses
are
cheap
if
you
want
anything
resembling
a
town
or
within
an
hour
of
the
city
77k
pop
of
portland
you
re
looking
at
much
much
more
expensive
housing
last
i
checked
median
home
prices
in
portland
for
example
were
over
600k
you
can
rent
a
decent
house
for
3
4k
per
month
or
an
apartment
in
a
cheaper
area
for
maybe
1400
2k
for
a
1
bed
1700
2800
for
a
2
bed
also
what
should
my
expectations
be
for
acadia
national
park
in
mid
november
will
there
still
be
plenty
of
hiking
and
parking
yes
it
s
not
the
prettiest
time
of
year
but
other
than
that
you
ll
be
fine
with
the
caveat
that
there
could
always
be
a
big
snowstorm
the
day
before
you
arrive
on
average
there
shouldn
t
be
any
snow
or
ice
yet
camden
restaurants
and
whatnot
will
still
be
open
in
november
for
sure
most
don
t
close
down
completely
aside
from
a
couple
week
break
in
february
or
something
the
big
unknown
will
be
the
weather
as
november
can
be
sunny
and
brisk
beautiful
days
or
crazy
friggin
snowstorms
where
hiking
or
driving
around
isn
t
really
recommended
in
camden
one
place
on
such
a
winter
s
day
to
spend
time
indoors
is
the
jack
its
a
bar
built
into
an
old
mill
and
apartment
complex
now
with
pretty
decent
food
and
indoor
bocce
and
cornhole
courts
its
kinda
fun
you
can
also
be
more
highbrow
and
go
to
the
farnsworth
museum
or
center
for
contemporary
art
something
like
that
in
rockland
two
good
museums
for
a
town
its
size
also
the
strand
venue
in
rockland
has
good
weird
movies
and
stuff
if
its
crappy
outside
if
its
not
crappy
weather
the
georges
river
land
trust
website
has
a
great
trail
network
in
the
area
and
there
s
always
camden
state
park
right
there
god
no
most
of
route
1
is
open
year
round
for
tourism
reasons
will
it
be
not
as
populated
a
few
places
shut
down
yes
but
the
average
tourist
will
still
have
plenty
of
places
to
hit
up
visitmaine
com
has
plenty
of
information
on
parks
and
such
local
facebook
groups
are
a
good
place
to
start
but
keep
an
eye
on
the
scams
obviously
lots
of
them
out
there
also
lots
of
landlords
that
are
looking
to
only
do
short
term
rentals
make
sure
you
read
any
contracts
thouroughly
zillow
com
and
apartments
com
are
a
good
tool
as
well
craigslist
can
be
hit
or
miss
used
to
be
really
great
but
has
been
lackluster
as
of
recent
get
heavy
dense
curtains
like
the
block
out
all
light
types
and
that
will
help
call
your
local
lumber
companies
to
get
started
they
work
with
local
contractors
and
keep
them
rotating
out
if
they
are
providing
bad
service
like
your
hammond
hancock
lumber
type
places
good
luck
it
s
a
tiny
downtown
just
walk
around
until
you
find
a
place
you
like
lol
the
downvotes
yeah
this
is
why
people
hate
reddit
subs
and
megathreads
hah
otto
s
is
very
meh
i
give
them
a
chance
every
now
and
then
but
it
s
never
quite
what
i
hope
it
ll
be
romeo
s
is
fine
you
gotta
get
the
double
dough
though
pat
s
is
basically
romeo
s
cousin
going
through
some
shit
we
believe
in
them
anyway
we
don
t
know
why
portland
pie
company
is
still
looking
for
their
seasonings
foreside
house
of
pizza
is
legit
pizza
joint
will
be
remembered
fondly
but
not
by
our
bank
accounts
what
are
you
guys
paying
for
propane
recently
eastern
charged
me
5
20
a
gal
which
seems
high
where
in
the
general
viscinity
of
york
would
be
good
places
to
avoid
there
are
literally
zero
bad
places
in
the
york
area
none
it
s
expensive
for
the
most
part
but
the
further
away
you
are
metro
areas
and
not
in
water
the
cheaper
it
gets
throw
a
dart
on
the
map
that
sounds
like
it
will
work
hard
to
pick
your
neighbors
really
if
you
want
to
be
near
a
sandy
beach
that
limits
things
significantly
you
can
search
election
results
by
town
for
the
most
recent
election
that
will
give
you
an
idea
of
local
political
leanings
you
might
like
midcoast
areas
like
damariscotta
newcastle
or
even
further
up
in
knox
county
i
m
up
that
way
we
have
gig
speed
fiber
in
our
town
you
can
search
by
address
witth
isps
like
spectrum
and
i
think
tds
fiber
to
see
internet
speed
options
really
with
a
bunch
of
dogs
you
will
have
extreme
difficulty
finding
a
place
to
rent
full
stop
buying
a
place
will
be
significantly
easier
if
you
have
the
resources
i
grew
up
in
maine
the
county
now
live
in
pa
no
you
don
t
know
cold
and
dark
but
it
isn
t
usually
fatal
and
you
ll
adjust
get
used
to
wearing
layers
and
you
ll
be
fine
there
s
a
reason
the
stereotypical
mainer
wears
a
t
shirt
a
long
sleeve
shirt
and
a
vest
it
works
for
most
of
the
months
but
the
sand
beach
within
walking
distance
will
probably
go
unfilled
maine
has
over
3
400
miles
of
coastline
but
only
about
70
is
sandy
most
of
that
is
in
the
southernmost
2
counties
if
ocean
access
is
more
important
than
sandy
beaches
then
most
of
the
rest
of
the
coastline
opens
up
southern
maine
hell
all
of
maine
is
overpriced
especially
for
the
wages
paid
if
i
had
to
move
back
i
would
look
at
lincoln
knox
waldo
counties
not
as
overpriced
as
southern
maine
not
as
cold
as
downeast
if
you
go
as
far
east
as
machias
then
your
dogs
will
leave
you
i
worked
there
for
the
month
of
may
one
year
and
could
not
get
over
the
constant
fog
after
2
weeks
of
24
7
fog
i
asked
if
it
is
foggy
for
the
whole
month
of
may
nope
was
the
answer
the
record
is
25
days
some
people
on
the
coast
don
t
figure
it
s
worth
growing
tomatoes
or
corn
because
the
heat
units
aren
t
there
i
spend
a
lot
of
time
in
hancock
county
ellsworth
area
and
people
from
away
who
just
accept
how
it
is
get
along
fine
for
instance
if
you
go
to
the
store
and
think
you
ll
buy
a
pound
of
butter
but
there
are
only
3
sticks
in
the
box
just
bring
it
up
to
the
cashier
she
ll
usually
a
she
just
multiply
the
cost
by
75
and
you
ll
be
on
your
way
it
happened
to
me
more
than
once
don
t
make
a
big
deal
about
it
they
only
stock
a
few
boxes
of
butter
but
they
have
a
wide
variety
of
liquors
not
sure
what
your
budget
is
but
the
kennebunks
biddeford
pool
area
have
sandy
beaches
are
very
dog
friendly
the
neighbors
are
friendly
community
fairly
open
minded
the
train
station
in
wells
makes
traveling
to
boston
a
breeze
blue
hill
friends
of
mine
used
the
uhaul
pods
service
don
t
know
the
brand
name
of
what
they
call
it
but
basically
you
go
to
uhaul
and
fill
up
the
crates
or
trailer
them
to
your
house
and
they
drive
them
to
your
new
place
worked
for
them
why
kennebunkport
where
are
you
flying
into
out
of
are
you
aware
that
these
two
towns
are
about
a
4
5
hour
accounting
for
summer
traffic
drive
apart
if
you
only
have
a
week
i
recommend
only
going
to
acadia
if
you
re
dead
set
on
the
two
then
i
guess
i
d
spend
most
of
my
time
in
acadia
late
july
in
two
of
the
most
touristy
places
in
the
entire
state
both
spots
are
going
to
be
rammed
with
tourists
just
so
you
know
there
s
plenty
of
opportunities
to
eat
and
drink
in
both
bar
harbor
and
kennebunkport
acadia
is
more
about
hiking
around
and
doing
outdoorsy
stuff
going
out
to
restaurants
in
both
places
can
be
taxing
as
you
might
have
to
wait
an
hour
or
two
for
a
table
just
about
anywhere
you
might
like
some
more
relaxing
places
with
lesser
amounts
of
crowds
like
belfast
even
for
a
single
night
belfast
is
1
2
way
between
bh
and
kbkpt
good
restaurants
charming
etc
easy
to
go
across
super
hard
to
come
back
also
canadians
drive
to
bangor
for
macy
s
and
other
stores
they
don
t
even
shop
local
you
will
need
to
pay
taxes
on
things
you
import
more
of
a
headache
to
try
and
shop
in
canada
then
just
driving
to
bangor
where
s
the
job
to
each
their
own
seems
kind
of
insincere
when
prefaced
with
your
two
cents
where
should
i
stay
thats
close
to
downtown
but
cheap
just
use
one
of
the
booking
sites
and
sort
by
lowest
price
there
are
no
secret
cheap
hotels
in
the
portland
area
cheap
and
portland
are
not
the
same
you
can
probably
find
a
motel
outside
of
the
city
for
cheap
and
any
time
is
good
to
visit
it
may
be
chilly
bring
warm
clothes
whether
it
s
an
ok
time
to
visit
really
depends
on
what
you
re
looking
for
if
potentially
cold
and
dreary
days
and
nights
appeal
to
you
sure
you
can
likely
stay
cheaper
outside
of
portland
portland
has
a
large
tax
on
some
of
their
moderate
to
very
nice
hotels
in
city
center
called
a
development
tax
which
is
pretty
funny
because
when
have
taxes
or
a
fee
ever
encouraged
development
lol
you
could
stay
in
old
orchard
beach
and
be
able
to
walk
to
beach
from
hotel
for
probably
half
the
cost
of
a
hotel
in
portland
and
not
have
a
begger
at
every
intersection
like
portland
there
s
a
whole
bunch
of
lakes
along
route
3
in
between
augusta
and
belfast
that
you
might
like
its
pretty
over
there
lake
st
george
is
nice
there
s
also
places
a
bit
further
south
around
damariscotta
lake
like
jefferson
alna
etc
that
are
nice
and
close
enough
to
either
damariscotta
or
augusta
gonna
have
to
drive
around
and
see
what
you
like
i
would
encourage
you
to
look
at
home
prices
today
there
are
currently
3
houses
for
sale
in
damarscotta
which
is
where
people
seem
to
be
directing
you
it
will
take
an
annual
income
of
ballpark
125k
to
afford
the
mid
priced
one
450k
i
m
even
assuming
you
ve
got
100k
to
put
down
you
re
not
going
to
get
that
income
in
that
area
unless
you
are
a
mid
career
engineer
commuting
to
bath
iron
works
or
a
lobsterman
who
has
a
good
season
there
is
absolutely
nothing
else
between
rockland
and
bath
that
could
pay
that
if
there
is
i
would
like
to
hear
about
it
bath
the
farmer
s
market
is
all
year
there
s
a
very
walkable
downtown
with
forest
preserves
and
20
minutes
from
the
ocean
and
right
on
the
river
i
grew
up
elsewhere
in
maine
and
moved
here
basically
sight
unseen
from
los
angeles
and
i
m
so
thankful
to
be
in
a
place
with
streets
to
easily
walk
my
dog
damariscotta
probably
has
what
you
are
looking
for
walkable
downtown
stuff
like
that
you
could
also
look
at
the
boothbay
area
and
newcastle
as
well
east
boothbay
is
nice
and
if
he
s
working
in
south
bristol
it
would
probably
be
easier
to
commute
via
boat
lol
on
a
nice
day
at
least
look
into
which
communities
get
to
send
kids
to
lincoln
academy
for
free
that
s
something
to
consider
i
don
t
rent
but
i
do
see
fb
local
message
boards
with
rentals
advertised
from
time
to
time
if
you
know
of
any
rooms
shared
housing
or
affordable
apartments
in
portland
that
s
going
to
be
your
big
problem
right
there
expect
to
be
required
to
plunk
down
first
month
last
month
security
deposit
on
any
apartment
i
would
look
at
local
fb
groups
i
m
not
in
portland
but
i
know
a
few
people
down
there
and
housing
is
tight
especially
on
the
cheaper
end
of
the
renting
spectrum
good
luck
and
i
mean
that
sincerely
because
you
are
going
to
need
it
affordable
varies
more
than
likely
in
portland
its
gonna
be
2500
average
check
out
facebook
local
groups
to
find
something
more
easily
tbh
or
check
out
the
portland
sub
good
luck
oh
ffs
hey
friends
don
t
let
the
nay
sayers
bring
you
down
there
is
a
huge
housing
crisis
in
maine
and
very
few
affordable
rentals
but
that
doesn
t
mean
you
can
t
try
facebook
marketplace
seems
to
be
a
decent
place
to
find
housing
opportunities
and
for
better
or
worse
you
may
not
be
able
to
get
to
portland
try
waterville
lewiston
augusta
bangor
some
will
try
to
tell
you
those
places
are
unsafe
but
comparatively
they
re
safer
than
most
big
cities
bangor
is
cool
i
guess
for
a
city
its
size
its
not
really
a
city
per
se
compared
to
other
places
but
for
that
part
of
maine
it
certainly
is
i
m
not
sure
what
college
noise
is
but
its
not
like
living
next
to
a
big
10
school
with
marching
bands
and
90
000
people
walking
by
for
football
on
saturdays
or
something
do
a
zillow
search
and
put
in
your
house
lot
size
desires
and
budget
and
see
what
comes
up
biggest
maine
specific
thing
i
would
look
for
in
a
house
is
the
heating
system
how
old
is
it
what
kind
oil
electric
heat
pump
wood
stove
and
factor
in
the
costs
of
each
into
your
monthly
budget
its
so
dependent
on
size
age
of
the
house
as
to
what
is
best
baseboard
electric
can
be
super
expensive
power
is
not
cheap
at
all
here
you
might
also
look
closer
to
the
coast
like
belfast
area
there
s
stuff
down
there
its
nice
a
little
further
from
mdi
but
not
much
further
than
bangor
it
s
extremely
difficult
to
succeed
with
a
small
business
in
a
tiny
poor
town
like
farmington
and
probably
doubly
so
if
you
aren
t
a
local
and
people
don
t
know
you
portland
more
open
brunswick
more
open
everything
else
north
and
more
rural
not
so
much
small
businesses
struggle
in
maine
until
they
get
established
most
towns
do
not
have
the
best
support
for
them
but
once
they
get
their
thing
going
they
do
well
enough
can
t
speak
to
the
hiring
of
law
firms
in
maine
but
there
are
basically
only
2
cities
with
any
sizable
law
practices
bangor
and
portland
same
with
banking
and
accounting
i
might
recommend
pursuing
an
in
person
mba
it
s
easier
than
you
think
and
just
doing
some
office
job
plenty
of
people
in
that
world
have
liberal
arts
degrees
the
ceo
where
my
wife
works
has
a
music
mfa
and
is
in
his
40s
that
s
if
you
don
t
mind
making
roughly
75
000
working
at
an
insurance
company
or
bank
it
s
not
glamorous
that
s
for
sure
but
that
sums
up
a
lot
of
office
jobs
in
portland
specifically
as
for
snow
this
might
be
recency
bias
but
it
is
less
and
less
every
year
our
southern
lakes
barely
freeze
over
now
the
northern
lakes
are
freezing
less
and
less
as
well
the
gulf
of
maine
is
the
fastest
warming
body
of
water
in
the
world
the
climate
does
feel
fundamentally
different
compared
to
when
i
was
a
kid
in
the
late
90s
early
2000s
contrary
to
what
many
in
this
sub
believe
i
don
t
think
maine
is
a
good
place
to
bail
out
from
climate
change
our
ecosystem
is
basically
the
southern
limit
of
a
white
pine
spruce
mixed
hardwood
forest
it
extends
westward
through
the
adirondacks
below
that
is
the
mid
atlantic
forest
of
oaks
cherry
other
hardwoods
they
are
very
different
forest
ecosystems
whose
range
is
determined
mainly
by
temperature
basically
our
forest
and
ocean
ecosystems
could
collapse
or
rapidly
change
there
is
a
ton
of
surface
water
in
the
northwest
of
the
state
and
all
of
our
major
towns
and
cities
are
vulnerable
to
flooding
we
saw
a
taste
of
it
last
winter
for
the
first
time
in
many
many
years
do
you
really
seriously
think
that
in
5
years
maine
will
be
as
hot
as
florida
and
have
no
snow
that
is
all
but
impossible
yes
the
winters
have
been
more
mild
over
the
last
few
years
i
had
my
corvette
out
in
february
and
march
for
a
couple
of
weeks
and
then
it
snowed
a
bunch
and
i
stuffed
it
back
into
the
garage
for
another
month
two
or
three
winters
ago
we
had
several
weeks
of
below
zero
weather
where
we
didn
t
even
get
above
0
during
the
day
as
far
as
being
welcome
of
course
you
would
be
mainers
take
issue
with
people
from
away
if
they
start
telling
us
how
we
should
live
or
if
they
start
doing
things
that
aren
t
neighborly
like
poisoning
trees
blocking
public
beach
areas
fighting
things
that
businesses
need
like
cell
towers
etc
etc
if
you
show
up
and
you
re
cool
everyone
will
be
cool
to
you
maine
is
one
of
the
best
places
for
live
and
let
live
if
you
aren
t
hurting
us
your
life
is
your
business
and
it
stays
that
way
a
great
example
of
this
outlook
is
how
quickly
maine
adopted
gay
marriage
we
were
one
of
the
first
states
in
the
country
to
do
so
if
your
career
is
based
in
the
legal
system
unless
you
could
work
remotely
you
will
find
more
opportunities
in
southern
maine
i
would
assume
someone
in
information
systems
it
could
work
remotely
so
that
would
open
up
a
lot
more
of
the
state
in
that
capacity
summers
can
be
just
as
hot
and
humid
as
south
just
not
as
long
think
bayou
humidity
for
a
good
month
and
a
half
and
hot
creeping
100
heat
index
for
several
weeks
you
have
no
place
to
hide
from
the
heat
and
humidity
unless
you
live
in
a
mountain
several
thousand
feet
up
come
experience
both
extremes
before
deciding
to
move
winters
are
still
cold
jan
feb
20
degrees
cold
summer
90
we
have
quite
the
seasons
with
that
said
the
two
months
of
fall
weather
we
have
are
always
amazing
with
70
highs
and
40
lows
overnight
its
great
but
not
for
everyone
maine
is
also
rural
i
don
t
mean
there
is
some
hicks
in
the
woods
down
the
road
a
few
miles
i
mean
majority
of
maine
is
rural
where
you
have
population
sizes
for
the
towns
less
than
one
or
two
thousand
people
outside
of
the
larger
towns
and
cities
think
portland
bangor
augusta
freeport
lewiston
auburn
brunswick
topsam
there
is
not
a
lot
to
do
if
you
are
not
near
southern
maine
or
along
route
1
and
you
say
you
like
the
outdoors
then
you
must
really
embrace
it
because
during
those
winter
months
when
its
blizzards
and
squalls
you
are
pretty
much
inside
by
the
fire
with
some
hot
cocoa
is
it
getting
warmer
up
here
yeah
i
haven
t
been
here
long
and
i
hear
about
how
folks
haven
t
needed
ac
in
the
past
and
we
definitely
do
now
but
it
s
a
sliding
scale
my
friend
it
ll
always
be
cooler
here
than
florida
that
said
i
d
strongly
suggest
finding
a
way
to
experience
some
winter
hardships
before
you
decide
on
maine
for
someone
rarely
above
the
mason
dixon
line
i
think
you
need
to
know
what
you
re
in
for
as
far
as
lawyer
systems
info
i
m
sure
you
could
find
work
better
than
most
i
m
going
into
law
best
thing
i
can
do
with
my
history
education
disagree
start
looking
now
especially
if
you
ar
looking
to
get
a
home
not
an
apartment
no
areas
to
avoid
maine
is
great
most
of
the
state
has
high
property
taxes
if
sanford
is
high
with
a
15
14
mil
rate
that
s
actually
in
the
lower
to
average
side
compared
to
many
other
areas
they
may
have
a
higher
assessed
value
or
just
not
know
how
much
other
towns
are
paying
make
sure
to
look
up
each
towns
rate
before
considering
that
area
to
get
a
feel
for
the
taxes
good
luck
childcare
can
be
hard
to
find
i
d
consider
starting
to
get
yourself
on
wait
lists
now
for
example
i
got
on
the
wait
list
for
a
local
center
when
i
was
pregnant
the
had
room
when
my
child
was
3
5
years
old
i
did
manage
to
get
into
another
daycare
before
then
but
depending
on
what
area
you
re
looking
to
be
in
care
is
limited
that
aside
welcome
why
are
you
renting
in
boston
or
portland
and
driving
from
there
bangor
exists
and
has
car
rentals
at
the
airport
it
would
save
you
so
much
time
also
you
definitely
don
t
need
a
4x4
to
go
into
baxter
i
ve
been
deep
into
the
park
with
my
honda
sedan
their
roads
are
in
really
good
shape
better
than
my
driveway
how
would
they
not
let
you
go
on
unpaved
roads
i
have
several
near
me
why
would
that
matter
are
you
telling
them
you
are
doing
offloading
because
driving
on
unpaved
roads
vs
offloading
is
a
massive
difference
your
budget
will
dictate
where
you
can
go
finding
a
place
with
a
couple
acres
in
maine
is
relatively
easy
outside
of
portland
and
or
bangor
city
limits
like
most
other
states
maine
funds
schools
through
local
property
taxes
so
better
funded
schools
are
in
more
expensive
towns
again
it
comes
down
to
budget
there
are
decent
grocery
stores
all
over
lots
of
places
for
chinese
food
pizza
and
sandwiches
most
places
that
s
all
there
is
no
shortage
of
gardens
or
chickens
lots
of
people
myself
included
have
both
you
should
come
to
maine
in
february
and
spend
some
time
driving
around
to
a
part
you
like
don
t
come
in
july
or
august
and
look
come
when
its
cold
and
dark
at
4
00
pm
cool
tons
of
places
meeting
that
criteria
if
you
can
afford
a
350k
mortgage
for
remote
areas
or
650k
for
more
popular
ones
that
are
still
outside
the
city
just
reading
through
the
comments
have
you
ever
been
to
rural
maine
it
s
more
of
an
acquired
taste
than
some
people
realize
i
m
a
fan
but
i
m
not
convinced
most
people
will
be
for
instance
i
have
family
who
lives
in
northern
maine
they
have
a
single
choice
for
an
internet
provider
which
isn
t
great
satellite
internet
has
latency
issues
that
make
some
types
of
internet
use
challenging
also
no
cell
service
there
the
roads
are
terrible
1
2
the
year
and
their
power
goes
out
pretty
often
medical
care
like
specialist
referrals
are
almost
unheard
of
they
drive
to
bangor
pretty
often
which
is
at
least
1
5
hours
each
way
assuming
the
roads
are
decent
the
nearest
decent
grocery
store
appears
to
be
a
45
minute
drive
although
there
are
smaller
variety
stores
closer
but
those
tend
to
be
more
expensive
and
limited
selection
understandably
so
they
are
decently
priced
because
it
s
unity
you
are
pretty
damn
rural
down
there
ok
is
there
a
question
here
west
branch
pleasant
river
there
s
camping
but
nowhere
to
live
since
it
s
all
owned
by
amc
logging
companies
where
you
will
end
up
will
be
largely
budget
driven
if
you
can
afford
cumberland
or
cape
elizabeth
that
s
awesome
most
people
can
t
if
you
can
t
then
there
s
a
few
dozen
towns
in
york
or
cumberland
counties
that
could
fit
your
needs
also
places
further
north
like
lincoln
county
or
knox
county
camden
has
a
great
school
district
for
example
as
does
damariscotta
newcastle
you
might
like
those
towns
if
you
want
to
take
a
look
if
you
are
left
leaning
portland
and
most
of
southern
maine
is
more
your
style
especially
if
you
lived
in
boston
is
the
only
thing
similar
even
if
it
s
a
fifth
of
the
city
the
further
north
you
go
the
more
rural
and
i
mean
population
of
500
2
000
and
not
left
leaning
with
maine
being
rated
last
in
the
nation
for
public
school
education
you
may
want
to
seriously
consider
absolutely
no
i
was
thinking
about
it
i
guess
i
get
nervous
to
make
big
posts
i
don
t
know
why
i
m
afraid
of
the
downvote
police
lol
i
think
i
will
though
here
s
my
sign
like
windham
s
awesome
thank
you
msp
seems
like
it
ll
be
a
good
fit
for
me
given
my
background
i
was
hoping
for
a
cheap
vacation
house
or
something
since
it
ll
be
off
season
and
winter
doesn
t
bother
me
it
ll
get
35
here
for
weeks
at
a
time
with
a
ton
of
snow
thank
you
there
s
breweries
on
north
haven
and
vinylhaven
too
now
deleted
deleted
just
fyi
getting
a
pcp
can
be
very
tough
check
into
this
before
moving
that
was
my
biggest
shock
moving
here
we
couldn
t
even
get
a
specialist
appointment
until
we
got
a
pcp
and
that
can
take
months
i
was
looking
at
bangor
and
bath
we
are
still
debating
selling
our
house
in
tennessee
or
renting
it
out
sounds
like
we
might
need
to
bite
the
bullet
and
sell
if
that
s
the
case
we
can
put
around
300k
down
on
a
home
and
that
would
put
us
in
the
500k
600k
price
range
for
a
home
in
bangor
i
m
concerned
with
none
of
the
houses
having
central
air
conditioning
but
i
think
we
will
be
alright
with
mini
splits
definitely
will
get
a
generator
i
m
ok
with
cold
what
will
be
rough
is
weeks
of
gray
skies
i
don
t
know
if
that
s
what
maine
is
like
or
not
many
places
with
extended
winters
also
have
the
gray
skies
that
go
with
it
you
re
exactly
right
we
need
to
be
near
health
care
and
amenities
i
know
it
won
t
be
like
where
we
are
coming
from
nashville
but
need
a
good
primary
care
doctor
and
a
neurologist
not
too
far
away
other
than
that
i
love
to
fish
and
my
wife
loves
hiking
we
are
pretty
simple
and
enjoy
walking
in
the
nieghborhood
with
our
dogs
and
talking
to
neighbors
we
decorate
the
house
for
holidays
and
enjoy
short
road
trips
which
i
think
new
england
is
perfect
for
thanks
for
your
help
is
it
really
not
they
make
it
sound
like
a
death
sentence
down
here
maybe
it
s
fear
of
the
ticks
we
don
t
know
but
will
do
thanks
for
the
time
table
aye
aye
thank
you
thank
you
so
much
this
is
really
helpful
information
we
ll
be
sure
to
plug
all
these
suggestions
into
our
map
itinerary
quick
question
heading
back
from
maine
to
ontario
are
there
any
worthwhile
stops
along
the
way
places
to
stretch
our
legs
grab
some
food
enjoy
some
scenery
we
ve
not
travelled
this
way
before
thanks
again
hi
me
and
family
are
looking
to
do
a
trip
to
maine
for
this
thursday
weekend
but
we
heard
about
the
dock
strike
this
morning
and
now
we
aren
t
sure
if
that
ll
affect
our
experience
as
we
re
looking
to
try
a
lot
of
seafood
could
you
possibly
weigh
in
this
don
t
overthink
it
just
walk
around
and
be
present
what
websites
can
i
buy
them
from
thanks
not
sure
why
this
is
being
downvoted
if
i
posted
it
in
the
right
place
i
expect
them
to
be
bad
but
i
guess
my
question
would
be
if
they
are
that
much
worse
in
june
than
other
months
to
the
point
it
d
be
worth
rescheduling
our
trip
to
july
or
august
my
bad
yeah
i
hear
you
crazy
that
250k
is
so
limited
these
days
my
father
paid
like
40k
for
his
house
with
several
acres
when
i
was
a
kid
definitely
a
little
far
of
a
drive
from
my
job
in
kennebunk
thank
you
i
will
look
those
up
it
s
a
small
state
you
d
have
more
luck
with
facebook
for
those
kinds
of
groups
i
know
there
are
a
few
for
mountain
hiking
and
probably
there
s
one
for
sugarloaf
carrabassett
valley
if
you
are
not
comfortable
with
facebook
i
don
t
know
what
to
tell
you
as
it
s
the
most
used
social
media
here
appreciate
your
input
i
have
lived
in
places
that
are
a
little
less
than
friendly
towards
us
unfortunately
fair
enough
i
guess
i
meant
more
is
it
a
biting
cold
and
does
it
snow
a
lot
i
have
winter
clothes
but
i
don
t
have
a
coat
because
i
don
t
think
winters
are
that
cold
at
least
in
michigan
ohio
and
i
don
t
have
snow
boots
either
since
i
don
t
get
a
lot
of
snow
here
thanks
for
your
help
i
ll
just
buy
something
there
if
i
need
it
will
do
thank
you
i
have
family
just
northwest
of
boston
so
it
would
be
nice
to
be
close
to
the
train
for
that
reason
mostly
ive
heard
a
lot
about
a
lack
of
work
or
people
having
a
hard
time
finding
doctors
stuff
like
that
do
you
think
theres
any
truth
to
that
maine
seems
really
reasonable
price
wise
but
ill
still
have
to
figure
out
weather
or
not
i
can
manage
to
work
in
state
or
if
i
need
to
hold
onto
something
remote
since
that
would
have
an
effect
on
housing
plans
or
slow
down
cause
deer
moose
or
cop
acadia
is
super
accessible
for
winter
hiking
the
park
loop
road
won
t
be
open
for
driving
in
february
but
pretty
much
every
mountain
can
be
accessed
from
a
public
road
or
from
the
vicinity
of
the
jordan
pond
house
which
you
can
access
in
the
winter
mdi
doesn
t
get
much
snow
anymore
and
what
it
does
get
often
warms
up
a
bit
and
then
freezes
hard
so
for
the
most
part
you
don
t
need
snowshoes
just
a
pair
of
microspikes
you
also
generally
don
t
need
the
level
of
cold
weather
gear
you
d
need
for
the
western
mountains
thanks
for
the
response
yes
everything
i
ve
read
shows
november
to
be
a
pretty
grey
month
weather
wise
it
just
what
worked
best
with
our
schedule
prior
to
holidays
not
a
bad
suggestion
on
the
local
beer
and
relax
for
the
week
okay
i
ve
visited
that
website
and
it
had
pretty
generic
information
i
was
trying
to
specifically
ask
about
certain
towns
areas
of
maine
during
the
month
of
november
per
the
request
of
the
thread
i
was
very
specific
on
time
and
location
not
sure
why
this
was
downvoted
we
ve
driven
thru
but
have
not
stopped
in
bath
that
might
be
a
good
option
thanks
thank
you
so
much
for
the
helpful
reply
i
will
edit
my
post
above
for
boothbay
as
1
word
my
phone
clearly
autocorrects
i
read
quite
a
bit
prior
to
posting
i
m
sure
someone
can
tell
me
if
they
disagree
but
i
found
this
blog
to
be
very
informative
https

https

yes
we
know
this
will
be
a
different
trip
anything
i
ve
read
november
and
april
are
the
oddball
months
but
appreciate
the
advice
maine
has
been
beautiful
every
trip
so
we
are
excited
regardless
i
don
t
really
love
the
sun
no
i
love
rain
and
snow
and
fog
and
cold
the
internet
situation
sounds
the
exact
same
as
here
in
reno
the
only
cable
provider
here
is
also
spectrum
though
i
did
manage
to
find
an
apartment
here
with
at
t
fiber
hopefully
i
can
find
a
spot
with
fiber
there
as
well
looking
at
cost
of
living
it
all
seems
to
be
less
than
here
average
gas
prices
here
in
reno
are
around
4
dollars
a
gallon
over
in
maine
it

average

prices
seem
better
too
nevada
being
the
second
most
expensive
behind
california
means
that
anywhere
is
going
to
be
cheaper
though
since
we
bring
in
so
much
of
our
stuff
from
california
we
end
up
paying
california
prices
on
it

which
is

i
work
from
home
and
am
in
great
health
somehow
i
m
a
fat
guy
in
my
40s
but
i
get
a
checkup
every
year
and
all
my
numbers
are
good
so
those
related
concerns
aren
t
so
bad
i
do
know
how
bad
salt
is
for
cars
so
if
i
need
to
take
a
trip
once
a
week
or
so
to
get
groceries
or
whatever
i
can
be
sure
to
hose
off
the
undercarriage
of
my
car
to
help
stave
off
salt
damage
i
bought
my
car
in
2022
and
it
has
under
4000
miles
on
it
if
that
gives
you
any
indication
of
how
little
i
drive
i
mostly
just
stay
at
home
and
keep
to
myself
though
i
do
like
to
go
for
walks
and
such
to
get
exercise
and
it
seems
like
it
d
be
way
better
to
do
that
somewhere
beautiful
instead
of
here
in
the
desert
i
ll
buy
some
snow
boots
i
currently
pay
1500
for
a
550sq
ft
apartment
with
no
amenities
other
than
in
unit
washer
dryer
no
pool
gym
etc
i
am
more
than
happy
living
out
in
the
boonies
i
d
rather
be
close
to
a
lake
than
to
a
city
and
have
a
job
that
allows
me
to
work
remotely
so
it
s
not
a
big
issue
for
me
to
be
close
to
a
city
as
long
as
i
have
a
grocery
store
and
gas
station
within
at
least
10
minutes
i
m
good
to
go
i
ll
have
to
check
with
the
local
lumber
place
and
maybe
to
local
facebook
page
deleted
that
is
high
i
recently
paid

you
re

thanks
hi
thank
you
yes
we
will
be
purchasing
not
renting
i
have
been
looking
at
a
lot
of
data
just
wanted
to
reach
out
to
people
that
live
there
because
that
is
often
a
way
to
get
a
sense
of
things
that
may
not
be
captured
in
the
data
i
will
definitely
look
into
the
fiber
and
isp
above
appreciate
it
thanks
for
the
info
tips
i
know
the
coastal
areas
are
pricey
but
also
have
been
stuck
in
arizona
a
long
time
and
it
is
very
hot
about
half
the
year
and
getting
worse
90
120
bleh
it
is
dusty
and
brown
and
i
can
now
very
much
appreciate
the
seasons
real
trees
and
weather
changes
definitely
miss
the
ocean
thank
you
thank
you
that
is
an
area
we
are
considering
appreciate
your
insight
thanks
we
actually
looked
there
but
we
want
to
be
further
south
we
also
need
high
speed
internet
for
our
jobs
i
ll
definitely
check
that
out
thank
you
portland
4
hours
isn
t
that
long
of
a
drive
kittery
thank
you
definitely
hard
to
narrow
it
down
but
this
is
a
great
start
lake
george
caught
our
eye
right
away
it
reads
like
satire
another
lgbt
couple
with
no
work
skills
trying
to
move
to
portland
excellent
information
heating
is
def
on
my
radar
we
have
a
pretty
wide
radius
of
where
we
can
go
cus
we
ll
both
be
fully
remote
work
but
we
like
to
go
out
to
restaurants
and
such
at
least
once
a
week
hence
the
bangor
or
portland
area
thank
you
i
can
t
recommend
pursuing
a
mba
without
a
job
in
hand
just
work
at
some
office
job
get
promoted
or
find
out
it
s
not
for
you
and
have
your
employer
pay
for
your
mba
once
you
re
worth
it
nobody
wants
to
hire
a
fresh
mba
grad
with
no
work
experience
much
less
pay
mba
grad
wages
appreciate
it
and
yeah
i
know
the
climate
question
is
silly
just
one
of
those
things
i
m
uninformed
about
and
the
nature
of
climate
change
causes
me
levels
of
paranoia
to
the
point
of
irrationality
i
love
shooting
sports
hikes
photography
stuff
like
that
i
also
still
have
that
childish
spark
of
lets
go
exploring
that
calvin
and
hobbes
so
thoroughly
impressed
upon
me
as
long
as
i
could
find
some
place
to
live
and
work
rural
wouldn
t
be
the
worst
thing
in
the
world
academia
is
a
fucked
profession
i
hate
to
say
it
no
ones
hiring
and
as
much
as
i
d
love
to
dedicate
8
years
of
my
life
to
the
study
of
armenia
one
of
my
passions
its
not
economically
feasible
law
provides
a
financial
out
for
me
and
at
the
very
least
if
i
go
into
tenant
law
ecological
law
or
hell
even
insurance
law
i
can
feel
like
i
m
making
a
dent
in
something
like
i
m
doing
some
good
thank
you
so
much
for
your
response
we
ve
loved
it
up
there
for
years
i
think
he
was
coming
from
the
context
of
az
current
home
our
property
taxes
are
pretty
low
but
honestly
it
makes
sense
when
our
property
here
is
just
dirt
again
thank
you
thank
you
i
will
start
looking
into
this
now
too
we
have
eventually
settled
on
getting
the
car
in
boston
just
for
the
convenience
of
not
having
to
drag
luggage
any
further
than
nessasary
because
we
will
already
be
in
boston
beforehand
and
that
s
where
our
flight
home
goes
from
we
re
from
europe
had
been
looking
at
portland
just
to
widen
the
search
net
no
it
s
just
written
in
the
t
cs
of
all
the
rentals
sixt
alamo
enterprise
hertz
etc
we
have
found
so
far
that
driving
on
unpaved
roads
is
not
allowed
and
that
the
insurance
won
t
cover
this
in
the
case
of
an
accident
definitely
plan
on
taking
that
advice
and
visiting
in
february
are
there
any
highly
recommended
realtors
guidelines
things
that
i
should
know
we
re
looking
to
buy
a
home
so
far
loving
what
i
ve
been
looking
into
we
d
like
to
stay
under
350k
for
a
home
we
re
about
a
8
10hr
depending
on
the
part
of
maine
away
so
we
would
be
buying
a
bit
long
distance
we
d
definitely
prefer
a
more
remote
area
are
there
any
specific
towns
you
think
we
should
look
at
or
counties
so
personally
what
we
want
ultimately
is
space
inside
space
outside
space
no
reason
for
a
drug
addict
to
be
in
our
yard
zonked
out
of
their
minds
no
kid
trying
to
kick
in
our
door
at
1am
on
a
school
night
i
ve
had
to
call
the
police
on
various
occasions
for
both
situations
space
for
chickens
space
to
grow
some
of
our
own
food
i
know
maine
is
a
much
colder
climate
in
general
so
we
plan
on
a
green
house
of
some
sort
eventually
we
don
t
want
all
the
things
at
first
they
take
time
and
money
i
work
from
home
so
from
what
i
ve
been
seeing
we
d
need
a
generator
i
already
have
the
green
light
from
my
job
and
my
national
certification
to
go
anywhere
i
already
drive
an
hour
and
a
half
to
see
a
specialist
where
we
currently
are
but
i
can
manage
myself
gotten
to
a
point
where
it
s
more
possible
we
typically
grocery
shop
once
a
week
i
don
t
mind
driving
a
bit
for
that
i
m
in
a
much
more
populated
touristy
place
now
and
we
also
have
one
choice
of
internet
provider
town
is
half
closed
for
off
season
getting
out
of
town
off
season
takes
minutes
but
upwards
of
a
half
hour
when
it
gets
touristy
we
want
to
become
more
self
sufficient
and
not
have
people
bother
us
decent
school
system
is
wanted
because
we
have
a
child
there
will
be
no
more
kids
a
one
and
only
haha
i
ve
killed
rims
on
our
roads
here
too
we
do
plan
on
going
up
in
like
february
to
make
sure
it
s
what
we
want
we
don
t
want
to
go
anywhere
warmer
than
we
already
are
we
want
to
stay
east
coast
ish
so
from
what
i
ve
been
seeing
reading
and
learning
this
is
what
we
want
i
am
open
to
any
and
all
information
and
any
criticism
for
maine
there
is
thank
you
kindly
good
to
know
thank
you
boston
was
great
when
i
was
in
my
20
s
but
now
i
m
looking
for
a
slower
pace
as
i
transition
into
my
40
s
apparently
it
s
43
in

39
in

https

news
best
states
rankings
education
nevada
ranks
lower
in
pre
k
12
and
we
re
in
a
particularly
bad
district
in
nv
we
ve
had
to
retain
a
lawyer
due
to
our
elementary
school
not
providing
the
legal
bare
minimum
so
even
an
average
school
in
maine
will
probably
be
an
improvement
of
course
most
people
don
t
heat
with
electricity
although
there
has
been
a
subsidized
push
to
get
people
on
heat
pumps
there
are
some
issues
with
that
including
the
high
cost
of
power
here
power
outages
in
rural
areas
in
bad
weather
and
lack
of
efficiency
when
it
is
really
cold
you
will
find
that
there
are
homes
built
during
the
energy
crunch
of
the
1970
s
that
have
electric
baseboard
because
heating
oil
was
very
expensive
some
have
been
retrofitted
to
oil
or
gas
some
have
not
most
people
are
using
gas
or
oil
and
many
people
will
also
have
a
wood
stove
as
backup
i
work
in
new
construction
and
probably
98
of
what
we
sell
is
gas
people
like
that
the
boiler
needs
very
little
maintenance
and
you
can
use
one
fuel
for
heat
hot
water
drying
clothes
cooking
and
running
a
generator
sorry
the
100
250
was
monthly

cost
i
fixed
the
typo
in
the
comment
if
you
and
your
child
are
a
resident
you
get
to
go
to
that
town
s
schools
there
are
no
fees
the
cost
of
public
schools
are
covered
by
federal
state
funding
and
local
property
taxes
wealthier
towns
will
generally
have
nicer
schools
60
70
of
your
property
taxes
go
to
the
school
budget
which
is
why
there
can
be
such
a
difference
town
to
town
it
does
sound
like
to
towns
from
portland
to
kittery
would
be
best
for
you
but
it
s
going
to
cost
you
especially
if
you
want
views
can
i
ask
what
interests
you
about
maine
because
alot
of
people
come
here
with
a
certain
idea
in
their
head
and
find
out
it
s
not
the
reality
of
living
here
totally
get
on
a
waiting
list
asap
it
s
not
continuous
gray
skies
we
have
just
as
many
clear
cold
blue
sky
days
in
the
winter
friends
who
lived
in
maine
a
few
years
and
moved
back
to
pittsburgh
tell
me
they
really
miss
maine
s
sunny
winter
days
you
don
t
need
central
ac
a
couple
of
mini
splits
or
even
window
units
will
do
just
fine
but
be
aware
that
if
you
have
medical
needs
a
wait
for
a
neurologist
appointment
even
if
you
re
already
a
patient
is
about
8
months
and
this
is
in
southern
maine
i
had
a
fairly
common
vascular
operation
that
is
only
done
in
three
hospitals
in
maine
and
those
hospitals
are
all
in
southern
maine
a
distance
of
at
least
2
hours
south
of
bangor
tldr
if
you
have
medical
needs
that
require
specialist
attention
you
are
going
to
want
to
be
in
southern
maine
near
portland
and
possibly
even
near
boston
even
if
you
don
t
want
to
live
right
in
portland
to
get
the
quality
of
care
available
in
nashville
you
d
really
have
to
go
to
boston
i
m
concerned
with
none
of
the
houses
having
central
air
conditioning
but
i
think
we
will
be
alright
with
mini
splits
you
absolutely
will
you
d
be
fine
with
a
window
unit
or
two
i
m
ok
with
cold
what
will
be
rough
is
weeks
of
gray
skies
i
don
t
know
if
that
s
what
maine
is
like
or
not
there
s
plenty
of
gray
skies
but
also
consider
that
today
sunrise
was
about
630
and
sunset
is
at
4
and
the
days
are
going
to
continue
getting
shorter
for
another
month
there
are
four
months
every
year
that
you
ll
barely
see
the
sun
if
you
work
indoors
until
5
we
definitely
get
weeks
of
grey
skies
but
we
also
get
weeks
of
clear
sun
for
many
the
issue
is
how
early
it
gets
dark
its
completely
dark
out
by
4
30
pm
right
now
with
your
price
range
you
should
be
able
to
find
something
don
t
worry
about
central
air
almost
nobody
has
it
here
just
get
heat
pump
s
and
you
will
be
more
than
fine
we
have
them
for
a
3100
sqft
house
and
they
work
great
we
put
them
on
the
dehumidify
function
and
the
house
is
totally
fine
honestly
i
would
not
put
down
the
entire
300k
on
a
deposit
i
would
reserve
at
least
50
75k
for
things
like
heat
pumps
generator
general
repairs
roof
etc
that
will
allow
you
leeway
to
look
at
houses
that
might
need
a
little
work
there
s
low
inventory
for
sure
plenty
of
opportunities
to
volunteer
all
over
the
state
if
you
do
end
up
in
bath
you
might
look
into
the
midcoast
conservancy
they
do
land
trust
work
and
trail
maintenance
and
stuff
all
around
the
area
oh
you
re
fine
if
that
s
your
price
range
i
think
bath
is
beautiful
and
i
think
you
d
have
multiple
options
for
hospitals
there
hourish
drive
anywhichway
as
far
the
ac
goes
i
think
it
s
a
must
now
my
last
two
summers
got
uncomfortable
for
me
heat
pumps
are
a
great
option
though
look
for
houses
with
that
edit
bangor
is
fine
too
i
live
near
there
and
there
are
definite
nice
spots
i
don
t
know
whereabouts
nashville
you
re
coming
from
but
yeah
it
ll
be
different
bangor
and
bath
are
both
tiny
from
what
you
re
used
to
check
out
belfast
as
well
further
up
the
coast
and
smaller
than
bath
but
still
has
a
diverse
community
right
on
the
water
with
all
that
midcoast
has
to
offer
to
my
knowledge
the
dock
strike
is
limited
to
the
unionized
dock
workers
in
the
longshoremen
s
union
the
vast
vast
vast
majority
if
not
outright
totality
of
local
seafood
is
not
unloaded
by
unionized
longshoremen
and
would
not
be
affected
restaurants
relying
on
shrimp
from
vietnam
or
some
other
imported
seafood
could
theoretically
be
affected
but
your
local
lobster
shack
will
not
be
here
s
a
link
https
letmegooglethat
com
q
ship
live
lobster
for
places
that
will
send
you
lobsters
it
s
too
generic
of
a
question
and
it
s
asked
repeatedly
we
have
1
3
million
residents
and
over
15
million
visitors
a
year
a
lot
of
people
do
the
summer
route
1
drive
you
will
have
company
today
black
flies
are
bad
most
of
the
year
the
time
they
aren
t
bad
is
winter
or
if
its
raining
where
i
am
which
is
not
close
to
baxter
really
the
black
flies
are
worst
between
mother
s
day
and
father
s
day
roughly
well
no
you
just
might
get
more
useful
answers
if
you
repost
there
that
s
all
he
also
made
a
lot
less
and
there
were
a
lot
less
amenities
for
the
price
to
be
that
low
people
are
living
longer
which
stretches
the
market
and
the
common
age
of
getting
your
life
together
stretches
along
with
that
i
think
we
re
comparable
to
michigan
especially
since
dover
foxcroft
is
well
inland
from
the
milder
coast
our
winters
have
tended
to
be
warmer
in
recent
years
but
certainly
it
can
be
biting
cold
at
times
where
if
you
have
to
be
out
in
the
weather
say
if
your
car
got
stuck
in
a
snowbank
or
if
you
have
to
shovel
yourself
out
you
would
want
to
be
dressed
well
enough
not
to
get
frostbite
you
could
get
by
without
people
do
but
it
wouldn
t
be
fun
ah
totally
get
wanting
to
be
closer
to
it
i
was
concerned
maybe
you
were
thinking
of
it
more
like
a
subway
train
and
it
s
definitely
not
i
think
much
like
the
country
jobs
are
a
little
challenging
but
mostly
depends
on
what
type
of
job
you
re
looking
for
there
s
definitely
industries
that
are
always
hiring
if
you
have
remote
work
now
i
wouldn
t
give
it
up
but
i
wouldn
t
be
too
discouraged
what
type
of
job
are
you
looking
for
housing
wise
like
the
nation
there
s
a
housing
shortage
i
think
fb
is
a
good
place
for
timely
listing
of
available
rentals
the
i
d
try
craigslist
i
think
healthcare
isn
t
that
hard
to
come
by
maybe
i
m
missing
something
i
ve
had
the
same
provider
for
a
few
years
at
this
point
but
any
time
i
need
an
appointment
i
m
able
to
get
in
within
a
couple
weeks
if
not
sooner
so
i
think
it
wouldn
t
be
that
hard
best
of
luck
on
your
move
if
you
decide
to
come
this
way
maybe
before
led
lights
not
really
the
case
anymore
no
one
can
tell
you
the
weather
it
could
be
80
and
sunny
with
a
random
heat
wave
or
10
and
snowing
everything
is
worth
visiting
only
you
can
tell
if
you
want
to
really
come
or
not
don
t
let
others
tell
you
not
to
use
the
guides
they
are
just
as
good
as
asking
strangers
try
the
facebook
page
travel
maine
it
tends
to
have
people
like
yourself
who
are
visitors
who
enjoyed
their
stay
and
are
excited
to
share
what
they
found
we
here
tend
to
be
a
bit
jaded
and
unresponsive
to
these
kinds
of
very
frequent
questions
you
didn
t
do
anything
wrong
https

there
s
also
a
new
sub
r
askme
where
you
might
find
a
less
grumpy
bunch
than
here
maine
maritime
museum
is
open
all
year
keep
in
mind
heating
costs
high
taxes
yearly
vehicle
excise
tax
for
the
life
of
the
vehicle
etc
heating
costs
are
no
joke
do
a
search
on
the
sub
for
some
examples
1500
is
about
average
for
a
1
bed
without
any
amenities
in
a
decent
area
grocery
store
within
10
minutes
isn
t
the
boonies
and
it
will
cost
you
to
live
so
close
to
one
i
pay
1600
for
a
2
bed
with
an
alcoholic
landlord
and
squirrels
in
the
attic
no
electricity
or
heat
included
no
gym
no
pool
no
washer
or
dryer
on
the
property
though
we
get
shared
use
of
garage
and
lawn
this
is
40
minutes
from
the
city
and
is
considered
a
steal
of
a
deal
you
ll
find
that
in
the
boonies
there
are
just
not
many
apartments
to
rent
even
if
you
have
the
cash
generally
1
beds
start
around
1300
if
you
don
t
mind
a
neighborhoods
generally
thought
of
as
sketchy
do
a
search
of
apartments
here
in
locations
near
grocery
stores
and
you
ll
see
what
i
mean
i
live
in
topsham
a
small
town
and
apartments
com
only
has
two
rentals
listed
for
under
2
000
in
the
whole
town
also
for
the
record
i
did
not
downvote
you
idk
who
did
the
yarmouth
location
is
better
than
the
others
take
that
as
you
will
my
brother
moved
back
after
many
years
in
tucson
he
chose
to
move
back
to
the
county
aroostook
don
t
do
that
to
yourself
he
was
from
there
his
partner
had
to
spend
time
with
a
psychologist
to
adjust
and
they
have
to
drive
200
miles
to
bangor
for
a
heart
specialist
some
people
are
just
stupid
you
re
welcome
it
s
a
great
place
to
live
work
trust
me
its
gonna
be
longer
than
that
if
you
are
planning
on
driving
the
entirety
of
southern
maine
to
down
east
during
peak
summer
time
no
but
it
will
definitely
be
not
fun
driving
in
traffic
and
for
a
honeymoon
lasting
a
week
idk
i
d
have
better
things
to
do
lol
if
you
re
dead
set
on
driving
i
d
skip
kennebunkport
and
go
to
portland
if
you
re
driving
that
far
south
for
foodie
things
i
m
assuming
then
portland
will
be
the
vastly
better
option
and
save
you
the
40
60
mins
accounting
ofc
for
route
1
summer
traffic
dover
nh
area
is
where
you
should
be
looking
rollinsford
is
a
decent
town
too
same
with
south
berwick
over
the
border
eliot
is
quiet
but
somewhat
more
affordable
the
new
kittery
apartments
right
along
95
are
going
for
2500
a
month
finding
rentals
in
kittery
is
impossible
lots
of
demand
between
boat
crews
and
yard
employees
but
there
s
good
living
down
here
between
dover
portsmouth
and
the
beaches
no
reason
to
take
on
a
1
hr
commute
from
portland
you
might
have
some
luck
on
the
nh
side
dover
and
portsmouth
aren
t
exactly
cheap
but
they
re
nice
towns
that
might
have
people
looking
for
roommates
too
especially
with
unh
right
there
there
s
more
areas
with
restaurants
than
you
think
rockland
camden
have
a
bunch
that
are
open
year
round
that
are
good
brunswick
and
bath
as
well
waterville
has
some
good
spots
you
should
spend
some
time
driving
around
if
you
can
before
deciding
you
can
probably
get
a
cheap
enough
winter
rental
for
a
few
months
when
the
season
is
over
law
provides
a
financial
out
for
me
don
t
count
on
it
esp
in
maine
if
you
re
not
in
the
top
1
of
your
class
none
of
the
larger
firms
in
maine
will
hire
you
and
there
aren
t
very
many
you
ll
end
up
hanging
out
a
shingle
and
trying
to
build
a
practice
on
your
own
and
unless
you
re
an
exceptional
salesperson
and
24
7
hustler
you
won
t
make
it
ah
makes
a
lot
of
sense
if
you
re
coming
from
europe
boston
is
a
great
international
airport
nowhere
near
as
crazy
as
jfk
or
atlanta
if
you
are
just
going
to
baxter
don
t
worry
about
roads
you
basically
take
the
highway
98
of
the
way
the
only
dirt
you
ll
experience
will
be
well
maintained
and
the
speed
limit
is
15mph
in
the
park
there
is
also
the
national
monument
next
to
baxter
the
road
systems
for
the
two
are
not
connected
honestly
if
you
are
a
nature
lover
or
hiker
just
go
to
baxter
id
recommend
just
hiking
katahdin
or
for
a
less
grueling
day
hike
one
of
the
other
mountains
with
a
view
of
katahdin
you
could
just
rent
the
truck
go
off
road
anyway
and
cross
your
fingers
that
no
damage
is
done
or
get
a
regular
vehicle
and
then
rent
atvs
for
that
type
of
activity
aroostook
is
the
cheapest
and
most
rural
county
in
the
state
just
hope
you
never
need
medical
care
aroostook
if
your
only
takeout
preferences
are
chinese
pizza
and
sandwiches
tons
of
land
and
nobody
will
blink
an
eye
if
you
want
chickens
and
a
garden
much
cheaper
than
the
rest
of
the
state
without
being
a
dump
there
is
still
plenty
of
crime
and
drugs
in
rural
maine
except
law
enforcement
has
just
a
handful
of
officers
to
cover
a
large
area
so
their
response
time
may
be
slow
dinging
a
rim
is
one
thing
but
sliding
off
a
road
into
a
20ft
30ft
ravine
and
having
18
wheelers
slide
into
you
is
another
i
had
a
family
member
almost
die
because
they
slid
off
the
road
and
they
only
found
him
because
they
d
just
entered
cell
service
and
located
them
that
way
without
cell
service
they
wouldn
t
have
found
them
in
time
they
also
came
close
to
an
18
wheeler
sliding
into
them
which
took
someone
else
s
life
sadly
rural
maine
is
also
not
a
fan
of
taxes
and
i
think
that
shows
in
the
school
systems
there
is
also
talk
of
reforming
the
cds
system
to
place
that
burden
on
the
individual
school
systems
which
i
think
means
the
rural
school
systems
are
going
to
be
even
further
challenged
than
they
already
are
cds
has
its
flaws
but
i
think
a
larger
regional
system
really
benefits
in
this
scenario
i
personally
don
t
know
anyone
who
uses
a
generator
for
backup
heat
because
they
are
temperamental
everyone
i
know
uses
a
woodstove
as
a
backup
heat
source
just
fyi
that
s
not
even
touching
on
the
culture
piece
of
rural
maine
have
you
heard
about
the
moose
flies
the
ones
that
actually
bite
the
burning
sensation
and
trickle
of
blood
is
a
feeling
i
won
t
soon
forget
i
just
think
it
s
really
important
not
to
over
romanticize
what
will
be
trading
one
set
of
challenges
for
another
set
of
challenges
i
think
if
you
want
a
big
house
with
acreage
and
in
a
nice
school
system
it
s
not
going
to
be
in
a
350k
price
point
and
this
is
the
same
advice
i
give
to
friends
and
family
i
think
there
is
a
reason
it
is
sparsely
populated
here
is
an
article
highlighting
the
drug
problems
in
downeast
maine
which
is
becoming
a
popular
relocation
hotspot

honestly
i
would
not
put
down

on
a

i
would

at

50
75k
for

like

general

roof
etc
the
300k
is

holding

that
got

lucky
buying

in

for

that
we

now
got
it
thank
you
so
much
we
will
obviously
keep
an
eye
on
the
weather
but
are
anticipating
chilly
grey
skies
which
is
fine
thank
you
so
much
of
all
things
i
ve
read
i
ve
never
actually
gone
to
that
facebook
page
but
it
seems
like
a
great
resource
i
understand
that
my
questions
might
have
been
asked
before
i
promise
i
did
search
prior
to
posting
but
maine
is
a
very
peculiar
area
there
are
so
many
mom
and
pop
spots
whether
its
food
hiking
towns
to
visit
etc
and
it
s
super
helpful
to
get
local
advice
my
friend
is
great
but
she
tends
to
stay
local
to
kennebunkport
biddeford
area
so
this
has
been
a
helpful
guide
as
well
again
appreciate
the
thoughtful
reply
thank
you
it
will
for
sure
be
a
visit
on
this
trip
given
the
varying
weather
conditions
bath
looks
great
thanks
for
the
head
s
up
looking
at
the
tax
rates
they
are
very
similar
to
here
in
reno
the
vehicle
excise
tax
is
only
a
tiny
bit
higher
than
the
government
services
fee
we
pay
each
year
for
registration
on
our
cars
looks
like
i
d
be
paying
405
for
the
maine
tax
where
as
my
current
registration
fee
is
only
around
375
state
income
tax
i
had
already
thought
about
since
nevada
doesn
t
have
one
that
s
a
big
difference
obviously
but
as
far
as
the
other
local
taxes
they
are
basically
very
close
to
the
same
to
way
less
your
sales
taxes
are
5
5
where
as
ours
are
8
265
i
think
people
underestimate
just
how
expensive
it
is
here
in
reno
which
i
understand
because
who
the
fuck
would
want
to
live
here
i
don
t
get
it
either
no
worries
thanks
for
the
comments
appreciate
getting
the
local
view
of
things
there
i
assume
most
people
who
comment
on
moving
anywhere
are
going
to
get
downvoted
by
the
people
who
are
tired
of
whatever
box
they
ve
put
me
in
sort
of
people
moving
to
and
ruining
maine
i
assume
the
downvotes
are
from
those
sorts
of
users
thanks
i
contacted
a
realtor
in
dover
but
he
has
yet
to
get
back
to
me
is
sanford
or
biddeford
reasonable
i
see
a
lot
of
affordable
apartments
in
sanford
and
biddeford
but
i
m
not
sure
if
they
re
too
far
perfect
thank
you
once
we
get
our
house
here
ready
to
go
on
the
market
and
we
have
some
houses
to
go
check
out
we
plan
on
spending
a
weekend
up
there
driving
some
towns
and
neighborhoods
if
you
re
willing
to
start
by
taking
on
public
defense
cases
you
can
find
plenty
of
work
that
way
there
s
a
massive
shortage
of
that
won
t
get
rich
doing
it
but
you
could
live
on
it
damn
well
hell
what
do
you
suggest
i
m
working
creative
writing
history
minor
in
film
a
lot
of
the
standbys
are
park
worker
archivist
not
sure
how
common
those
are
anywhere
i
dont
ever
suspect
i
ll
make
a
living
off
my
writing
you
cannot
drive
atvs
or
motorcycles
on
any
nmw
roads
definitely
not
in
baxter
either
will
definitely
check
out
the
atv
idea
didn
t
even
think
of
that
oh
there
s
absolutely
drugs
everywhere
i
don
t
argue
that
in
the
least
especially
when
there
s
affordable
housing
just
when
there
s
30
houses
with
5
ft
of
space
in
between
or
not
even
neighbors
are
attached
it
s
a
lot
more
in
your
face
picking
up
needles
before
we
can
play
outside
less
than
10
ft
from
our
door
is
frustrating
we
have
green
heads
down
here
unsure
how
they
compare
chiggers
wolf
spiders
black
widows
brown
recluse
they
re
nasty
anywhere
we
ve
looked
at
has
some
type
of
bitch
ass
bug
or
spider
not
going
south
because
tarantulas
and
scorpions
i
can
cover
myself
in
deet
and
still
get
bit
there
s
definitely
pros
and
cons
to
everywhere
and
i
truly
do
appreciate
you
going
in
so
much
detail
about
some
of
the
cons
i
figured
generator
as
you
said
the
power
goes
out
ive
heard
the
electric
base
boards
are
expensive
so
many
use
wood
stoves
as
the
back
up
as
far
as
heat
goes
from
some
of
what
i
ve
looked
at
some
particular
towns
have
better
scores
according
to
niche
idk
if
that
s
accurate
than
where
we
currently
are
not
even
a
big
house
just
a
bedroom
for
us
one
for
the
kid
and
a
third
i
can
use
as
an
office
i
guess
a
3
bedroom
is
considered
big
in
the
current
housing
shenanigans
though
we
ve
been
looking
for
2
3
acres
ideally
but
fully
aware
the
world
esp
housing
market
are
not
ideal
the
gas
grid
is
in
the
cities
only
the
lack
of
population
density
maine
s
population
is
very
rural
and
spread
out
and
the
geography
very
mountainous
lots
of
ledge
in
the
ground
prevents
us
from
having
a
very
large
gas
grid
most
people
on
gas
are
on
bottled
propane
gas
i
live
outside
of
bangor
most
of
bangor
and
brewer
are
on
a
gas
grid
but
there
is
no
gas
where
i
am
just
a
few
miles
outside
of
bangor
we
have
bottled
gas
maine
is
better
if
you
want
a
nice
blend
between
urban
and
rural
life
there
is
no
urban
life
in
maine
yes
that
does
sound
like
the
right
price
for
houses
there
just
fyi
that
a
ats
standby
generator
installed
and
all
that
will
cost
you
north
of
10k
depending
on
the
size
of
your
house
and
if
you
need
electrical
upgrades
we
got
a
20kw
standby
which
might
be
overkill
but
its
nice
knowing
that
when
it
kicks
on
and
it
will
you
are
good
to
go
and
don
t
have
to
run
around
turning
everything
off
we
don
t
run
the
dryer
for
example
when
its
on
but
we
cook
with
our
electric
range
watch
tv
have
the
heat
pumps
or
if
its
super
cold
furnace
going
etc
you
will
definitely
want
one
though
we
had
some
big
rainstorms
a
few
years
ago
that
knocked
down
all
kinds
of
trees
some
friends
of
ours
had
their
basement
flood
after
their
power
went
out
and
took
the
sump
pump
with
it
they
were
literally
hauling
buckets
of
water
out
of
their
basement
for
hours
until
i
got
an
old
generator
from
my
mil
s
house
and
got
it
running
for
them
we
had
two
sumps
going
like
crazy
for
hours
to
drain
out
the
basement
it
was
wild
they
bought
a
standby
generator
right
after
that
yeah
i
think
it
s
a
similar
sentiment
here
people
think
it
s
cheaper
than
it
is
it
adds
up
though
stuff
ppl
don
t
think
about
average
mpg
in
a
car
is
less
in
winter
cars
don
t
last
as
long
because
they
re
eaten
away
by
rust
income
tax
is
a
big
one
heating
costs
a
lot
driving
anywhere
in
a
snow
storm
takes
twice
as
long
if
you
have
a
home
you
gotta
shovel
your
driveway
or
pay
someone
20
40
per
storm
to
do
it
if
the
power
goes
out
and
you
have
no
generator
congrats
you
gotta
re
buy
half
your
groceries
even
things
like
your
shoes
if
you
aren
t
careful
mud
salt
rain
ruins
em
quick
medical
care
is
hard
to
get
and
if
the
accident
is
bad
enough
you
can
get
taken
by
helicopter
to
boston
anecdotally
you
ll
see
people
on
this
subreddit
who
currently
live
in
the
bay
area
of
california
but
can
t
afford
to
move
back
home
to
coastal
maine
that
also
happens
a
lot
lol
a
ton
of
people
are
just
so
tired
of
out
of
staters
saying
wow
maine
looks
like
a
postcard
and
it
s
cheap
then
searching
for
housing
then
coming
back
and
saying
where
s
the
secret
housing
listings
locals
use
and
we
have
to
tell
them
that
no
they
aren
t
missing
anything
these
are
the
same
listings
we
all
see
lol
how
do
locals
afford
it
here
either
they
have
a
house
paid
off
from
long
ago
or
they
moved
here
with
a
nyc
boston
salary
or
they
had
to
move
to
other
states
where
housing
is
more
affordable
you
do
have
an
edge
if
you
have
a
wfh
job
though
biggest
problem
for
locals
is
most
of
the
jobs
are
in
portland
area
and
any
decent
housing
around
there
is
at
least
500k
180
250k
for
mobile
homes
isn
t
unheard
of
either
sanford
and
biddeford
are
reasonable
drives
but
it
still
adds
to
your
living
costs
i
recommend
craig

watch
out
for
scammers
trying
to
harvest
identity
data
and

for

hunting
not
sure
what
you

you

idk
after
a

of
soul
searching
im
never

a

dawg
it
would
chew
me
up
portland
100
has
a

and
probably
one
of
the
more
substantial
ones
where
that
is
the
largest
city
in

i
would
imagine
it
extends
into
many
of
the
bedroom
communities
that
surround
portland
kittery
has

as
well
definitely
not
urban
it
s

medium

people
have
those
and
they
are
better
than
nothing
for
sure
see
above
regarding
the
basement
story
but
an
ats
generator
is
the
way
to
go
if
you
can

they
can

a

i

i

trying

today
don
t
touch
the

but
don

worry
about
it
being
in

beforehand
or
on
the
ground
when
the
snow
melts
when
it
is
in

air
you
breathe
it
is
just
fine
but
when
you
can
see
it
in

snow
and
it
looks
like
a
shit
stain
it
is
something
you
should
not
touch
but
it
is
perfectly
safe
mind
you
i
am
trying
to
make
sense
of
this
rumford
wgme
a
malfunction
at
the
rumford
paper
mill
has
turned
nearby
snow
brown
people
are
advised
to
avoid
the
snow
town
officials
don
t
believe
this
is
a
threat
to
public
health
but
it
was
pretty
alarming
for
residents
who
started
noticing
the
brown
looking
snow
tuesday
morning
the
town
manager
says
the
brown
appearance
is
from
a
release
of
spent
black
liquor
from
the
nd
paper
mill
on
hartford
street
that
substance
is
released
as
an
aerosol
and
then
fell
onto
the
ground
with
the
snow
the
department
of
environmental
protection
has
tested
the
snow
and
found
it
has
a
ph
level
of
less
than
8
water
has
a
ph
of
7
so
that
result
brought
significant
relief
to
town
officials
still
their
advice
is
to
stay
away
from
the
brown
snow
the
town
is
telling
residents
not
to
eat
it
or
make
direct
contact
with
it
the
paper
mill
has
agreed
to
pay
for
secondary
testing
to
confirm
the
dep
s
findings
but
the
town
manager
says
he
s
confident
it
is
non
toxic
it
did
not
have
any
strong
odors
associated
with
it
rumford
town
manager
george
o
keefe
said
it
was
not
doing
anything
in
the
water
or
ground
panic
is
a
little
strong
but
i
think
certainly
shock
we
didn
t
know
what
it
was
and
we
had
to
work
very
hard
with
everybody
to
figure
that
out
r
nottheonion
expect
more
of
this
as
we
kiss
the
epa
goodbye
just
like
the
good
old
days
i

to

you
go
where
the
huskies
go
then
please
don
t
eat
that
yellow
snow
and
stay
out

moxie

i
couldn

taste
the
taste
that
i
was
tasting
i
couldn

i
was
making
tired
of
the
life
i
was
facing
i
couldn

tell
one
from
another
i
couldn

from
my

any

out

out

s
don
t
eat
yellow

by
ip
freely
i
thought
it
was
the
yellow
snow
we
had
to
watch
well
when
it
s
in
the
air
i
think
the
idea
is
that
it
isn

at
that
moment
tainted
with
their

if

by

all
have
close

it
s
a
story
of
a
small
group
of
twenty
somethings
rallying
together
to
try
and
save
the
fate
of
their
town
we
hope
you
enjoy
and
please
let
us
know
what
you
think
can
you
visit
this
place
this
looks
exactly
like
the
picture
i
took
gif
giphy
zrwehmrqeimgokiqki
downsized
this
place
is
worth
visiting
you
only
need
about
an
hour
but
we
were
there
for
2
5
just
amazing
absolutely
i
ve
been
a
few
times
it
s
impossible
to
take
a
bad
picture
from
anywhere
in
the
place
it
s
even
been
used
in
movies
and
tv
shows
we
visited
their
haunted
walkthrough
and
it
was
a
blast
you
can
visit
and
i
highly
recommend
the
audio
tour
there
and
any
of
the
smaller
guided
tours
where
they
take
you
to
particular
parts
that
are
not
open
to
the
public
normally
we
toured
the
medical
wing
you
can
also
just
walk
around
the
tour
is
only
an
hour
very
interesting
history
and
perspective
on
the
prison
system
visually
arresting
as
you
can
see
nice
i
need
to
make
time
to
go
there
looks
really
cool
with
lawyer
thomas
dickey
of
blair
county
by
his
side
mangione
stood
before
a
full
courtroom
where
he
contested
extradition
keeping
him
in
pennsylvania
for
the
time
being
he
was
placed
in
sci
huntingdon
with
bail
denied
once
again
as
of
now
dickey
has
14
days
to
apply
for
writ
of
habeas
corpus
however
the
commonwealth
has
30
days
to
get
a
governor
s
warrant
if
habeas
corpus
is
filed
another
hearing
for
mangione
will
be
scheduled
i
think
that
s
why
ny
rushed
to
file
charges
because
they
knew
once
he
caught
the
actual
charges
in
pa
pa
was
going
to
have
more
authority
over
mangione
than
they
would
i
also
been
saying
i
think
he
intentionally
got
caught
in
rural
pa
so
he
doesn
t
have
to
prepare
for
a
murder
trial
in
crazy
ass
rikers
island
blair
county
has
a
few
hundred
inmates
maybe
mostly
tweakers
and
petty
thieves
rikers
has
like
15
000
inmates
and
is
generally
known
as
one
of
or
maybe
even
the
most
dangerous
jail
prison
in
the
us
i
have
a
feeling
that
s
why
he
sat
down
to
eat
in
plain
sight
in
a
small
ass
town
where
it
s
easy
to
be
identified
he
wanted
to
defend
himself
from
pa
taking
a
page
out
of
trump
s
book
contest
every
part
of
the
process
appeal
every
adverse
decision
spin
everything
to
make
yourself
seem
to
be
a
virtuous
victim
is
there
any
kind
of
group
protest
or
rally
being
organized
to
take
place
at
the
courthouse
or
somewhere
he
is
a
national
hero
so
they
better
not
fafo
nah
it
wasn
t
him
it
was
two
asian
guys
all
a
big
misunderstanding
if
the
unibrow
doesn
t
fit
you
must
acquit
has
completely
convinced
me
that
social
media
is
in
fact
the
cause
of
most
of
our
problems
in
politics
and
culture
in
general
defending
a
pre
conceived
ideal
despite
mounting
evidence
to
the
contrary
with
insane
conspiracies
is
not
just
a
maga
problem
anymore
won
t
matter
he
can
delay
it
a
few
months
max
what
s
the
play
here
why
would
it
be
better
for
his
lawsuit
he
s
dead
gif
giphy
xxpkxnm5srvna
there
is
no
chance
he
won
t
be
extradited
the
only
reason
to
contest
is
to
buy
time
it
s
so
cute
that
you
all
seem
to
live
inside
a
reddit
echo
chamber
this
man
is
no
hero
he
s
a
murderer
and
gov
shapiro
isn
t
going
to
cover
for
this
fool
on
my
knees
for
him
he
ll
be
in
ny
within
a
few
weeks
just
a
guy
trying
to
prove
that
he
s
the
smartest
in
the
room
he
s
seen
his
last
day
of
freedom
from
here
on
out
it
s
prison
surprised
he
didn
t
represent
himself

weird
i
wonder
how
many
emails
they
ve
already
gotten
about
this
maybe
i
misunderstand
the
legal
system
but
doesn
t
pa
court
only
deal
with
the
extradition
they
can
t
try
him
for
an
out
of
state
crime
he
either
gets
extradited
to
a
court
of
competent
jurisdiction
ny
or
he
doesn
t
still
probably
not
as
bad
as
rikers
but
the
article
says
he
s
at
sci
huntington
which
has
about
1850
prisoners
i
m
not
sure
why
they
took
him
there
instead
of
the
blair
co
jail
he
ll
be
back
in
ny
soon
he
s
not
charged
with
murder
in
pa
you
think
he
gets
to
stay
in
pa
until
adjudication
that
is
not
how
it
works
he
did
not
know
any
more
about
extradition
than
you
do
there
s
a
jail
in
state
college
45
minutes
away
from
altoona
and
it
s
a
big
jail
also
not
sure
if
he
would
be
put
there
if
he
had
to
not
sure
how
this
works
reddit
still
pretending
he
is
a
criminal
mastermind
not
a
mental
patient
that
committed
murder
problem
is
that
luigi
doesn
t
have
several
24
7
propaganda
outlets
supporting
him
lol
no
not
in
this
town
it
s
all
old
people
here
they
probably
want
this
over
with
before
we
have
time
to
organize
any
political
support
protest
for
what
that
he
assassinated
a
man
you
support
murder
internet
tough
guys
upset
the
murderer
was
caught
the
were
speaking
some
weird
foreign
language
it
sounded
like
aaasssiaaannn
i
heard
a
few
average
joes
in
dollar
tree
talking
about
this
just
the
other
day
it
s
not
just
a
reddit
echo
chamber
as
far
as
i
can
see
not
really
an
echo
chamber
go
outside
and
talk
to
normal
working
class
people
vast
majority
of
people
think
of
him
as
a
hero
it
s
only
the
lowest
of
the
low
of
bootlicker
that
says
what
you
say
let
me
know
how
uncle
sam
s
cock
feels
down
your
throat
i
was
always
curious
i
don
t
think
anyone
is
expecting
him
to
get
off
but
the
amount
of
support
he
s
getting
for
a
cold
blooded
execution
sends
a
powerful
message
to
the
people
who
profit
from
the
death
and
the
hardship
of
others
maybe
they
ll
start
to
think
twice
or
maybe
they
won
t
either
way
they
ll
probably
be
asking
themselves
am
i
next
don
t
let
them
get
you
down
king
agree
ted
bundy
thought
he
was
smarter
than
the
system
and
we
saw
how
that
worked
out
for
him
dude
is
clearly
not
right
he
described
his
arrest
as
completely
out
of
touch
with
lived
experience
of
the
american
people
no
it
s
not
out
of
touch
to
arrest
a
murderer
but
if
you
were
manic
you
might
see
it
that
way
lol
why
my
donors
told
me
to
pretend
i
didn
t
see
or
hear
you
i
was
going
to
write
to
him
asking
about
why
we
shouldn
t
condone
violence
but
should
be
okay
with
him
signing
bombs
killing
innocent
people
but
i
guess
i
ll
put
in
pin
in
it
i
don
t
think
the
response
i
d
get
would
be
too
friendly
anyway
i
m
going
to
call
and
point
out
that
those
heroes
he
so
proudly
proclaimed
good
for
the
community
have
murdered
more
people
than
luigi
there
and
cost
taxpayers
less
money
especially
if
the
uhc
changes
its
policies
to
stop
rejecting
everyone
by
ai
which
was
introduced
by
the
dead
ceo
pa
filed
charges
against
him
too
for
presenting
the
fake
id
and
having
the
unregistered
firearm
he
was
charged
with
illegal
firearm
possession
there
in
pa
so
they
ll
likely
hold
him
there
since
he
s
high
profile
the
security
level
at
blair
co
may
have
been
too
low
many
of
those
rural
county
jails
in
pa
are
minimums
probably
even
below
minimum
in
some
cases
and
from
what
i
m
reading
sci
huntington
has
around
200
inmates
but
it
is
classified
as
a
maximum
security
prison
so
that
s
probably
why
he
s
there
it
s
probably
a
place
where
they
would
hold
federal
prisoners
who
are
back
in
pa
for
court
it
isn
t
uncommon
for
high
profile
cases
to
be
housed
in
the
nearest
available
sci
blair
county
jail
wouldn
t
have
the
capacity
and
security
there
were
talks
to
build
a
new
prison
so
it
is
likely
dated
too
but
he
s
indeed
charged
with
felonies
in
pa
so
ny
will
have
to
wait
pa
filed
charges
1st
at
the
time
the
pa
charges
were
filed
he
was
still
only
a
suspect
in
ny
he
is
in
pa
custody
and
ny
will
have
to
work
with
pa
for
the
extradition
not
the
other
way
around
i
am
not
saying
he
ll
never
go
to
ny
but
i
think
he
could
be
in
pa
until
he
gets
a
pa
trial
date
at
least
i
ve
been
saying
all
along
he
just
never
thought
he
would
get
caught
they
always
think
they
are
smarter
than
everyone
else
in
that
respect
it
is
like
a
tv
show
he
has
edgy
people
on
reddit
at
least
we
are
the
network
luigi
also
murdered
someone
murderers
go
to
jail
a
long
time
as
they
should
let
s
hope
you
re
never
accused
of
a
crime
homie
it
s
still
innocent
until
proven
guilty
in
this
country
for
now
no
we
don
t
support
insurance
companies
murdering
people
with
claim
denials
kyle
rotten
house
killed
multiple
people
and
was
practically
given
a
parade
by
republicans
so
we
re
just
celebrating
like
they
did
innocent
until
proven
guilty
since
when
is
taking
out
garbage
illegal
you
support
fascism
yes
they
do
they
ll
try
to
hide
it
or
obscure
it
but
they
do
awe
is
the
snowflake
boot
licker
sad
we
don
t
care
about
the
dead
rich
guy
i
worship
you
for
saying
this
the
cable
guy
never
gets
old
i
believe
he
used
the
word
injust
actually
i
think
out
of
touch
was
someone
mishearing
what
he
said
very
smart
individual
sorry
to
tell
you
this
but
donors
are
not
what
s
stopping
politicians
from
celebrating
murder
glad
this
has
exposed
shapiro
as
just
another
empty
suit
to
people
who
may
not
have
been
paying
attention
good
point
i
would
not
be
surprised
if
the
pa
da
stays
those
charges
in
order
for
him
to
be
extradited
you
don
t
register
firearms
aside
from
select
states
unless
the
charge
is
about
unlawfully
having
a
supressor
or
carrying
without
a
permit
edit
made
a
change
to
add
unlawfully
carrying
because
i
should
have
stated
that
before
since
its
obvious
the
unregistered
firearm
part
triggers
me
no
pun
intended
pa
doesn
t
have
a
defacto
gun
registry
they
do
keep
record
of
sales
so
initial
buyer
is
on
record
of
course
as
well
as
transfers
only
for
handguns
but
it
is
more
than
legal
for
me
to
make
a
handgun
without
a
serial
number
and
carry
it
in
pa
as
long
as
i
don
t
sell
it
manufacturing
a
firearm
for
personal
use
is
a
legally
protected
activity
maybe
it
s
different
for
an
out
of
state
resident
in
pa
i
used
to
work
there
back
in
2019
we
had
2400
inmates
google
earth
it
the
prison
is
huge
pa
did
not
file
murder
charges
pa
does
not
have
jurisdiction
over
the
murder
there
is
no
plausible
way
for
him
to
fight
the
murder
charge
in
substance
from
pa
the
pinnacle
of
sacrifice
i
could
stand
in
the
middle
of
fifth
avenue
and
shoot
somebody
and
i
wouldn
t
lose
any
voters
ok
donald
j
trump
then
why
wasn
t
that
ceo
in
jail
eh
trumps
a
rapist
a
pedophile
and
a
treasonist
let
s
not
go
pretending
his
child
diddling
supporters
care
about
murder
lmao
in
fact
haven
t
they
quite
literally
said
they
don
t
care
who
he
kills
wait
didn
t
they
make
the
guy
who
drove
to
another
state
to
shoot
random
protesters
a
folk
hero
this
guy
did
a
public
service
you
re
just
mad
he
killed
a
billionaire
if
he
had
killed
a
4
year
old
you
wouldn
t
think
he
deserved
jail
we
know
you
people
i
m
just
calling
a
spade
a
spade
the
entire
menendez
trial
replaying
in
the
background
of
that
movie
is
epic
i
definitely
didn
t
see
the
ending
coming
the
first
time
i
watched
it
deleted
why
worried
private
equity
is
next
you
can
t
expect
our
government
to
openly
support
extrajudicial
murder
maybe
they
mean
carrying
without
a
conceal
carry
permit
deleted
it
was
an
illegal
ghost
gun
that
he
used
yeah
you
re
right
pesky
google
ai
failed
me
again
preparing
to
fight
the
murder
charges
he
knows
are
coming
he
bought
himself
time
ny
hasn
t
filed
anything
that
s
what
people
are
saying
he
hasn
t
been
charged
for
murder
yet
there
is
no
murder
charge
to
fight
yet
luigi
is
the
worst
martyr
since
george
floyd
did
the
quote
hurt
you
if
brian
thompson
rolled
up
to
the
hospital
and
started
shooting
people
in
the
back
he
d
be
in
jail
because
he
was
rich
don
t
you
know
how
our
2
tiered
justice
system
works
whataboutism
and
accusations
without
evidence
all
over
this
comment
shouldn
t
you
be
encouraging
more
crazy
people
to
kill
rich
people
so
you
can
feel
like
a
revolutionary
you
re
bootlicking
all
over
this
thread
you
re
being
down
voted
for
being
purposefully
obtuse
his
point
was
clearly
that
he
finds
it
to
be
an
injustice
because
in
his
opiniom
the
company
and
ceo
are
murders
yet
he
s
the
only
murderer
being
arrested
you
can
disagree
but
don
t
be
thick
nope
because
i
don
t
support
killing
people
even
with
due
process
right

he
was
charged
with
that
a
few
other
things
too
he
was
arraigned
in
blair
county
pa
where
he
was
charged
with
five
crimes
including
carrying
a
gun
without
a
license
forgery
falsely
identifying
himself
to
the
authorities
and
possessing
instruments
of
crime
according
to
the
criminal
complaint
weird
that
5
charges
were
mentioned
but
just
4
were
listed
maybe
the
instruments
of
crime
charge
encompasses
the
gun
and
supressor
maybe
they
cant
charge
with
an
illegal
firearm
and
illegally
owning
a
supressor
because
that
would
be
an
atf
charge
there
is
no
registry
of
firearms
in
pa
it
s
actually
prohibited
by
state
law
maybe
you
re
confusing
the
4473
for
a
registry
for
example
they
allow
private
sales
of
firearms
in
pa
unless
you
have
a
sbr
or
suppressor
which
i
doubt
based
on
your
comment
nothing
is
registered
you
just
need
to
pass
a
background
check
through
the
ffl
edit
i
m
into
guns
concealed
carrying
and
have
lived
in
pa
my
whole
life
i
live
in
pa
as
well
and
no
you
re
fuckin
not
required
to
register
a
firearm
idk
if
it
would
matter
what
was
used
it
would
matter
what
was
being
possessed
semantics
but
pa
jurisdiction
vs
ny
juristiction
it
seems
that
it
was
a
3d
printed
gun
and
the
suppressor
was
apparently
3d
printed
as
well
but
he
caught
5
total
charges
per
the
nyt
before
he
was
charged
in
new
york
he
was
arraigned
in
blair
county
pa
where
he
was
charged
with
five
crimes
including
carrying
a
gun
without
a
license
forgery
falsely
identifying
himself
to
the
authorities
and
possessing
instruments
of
crime
according
to
the
criminal
complaint
edit
maybe
he
wasnt
charged
with
owning
a
3d
printed
gun
in
pa
yet
because
that
would
be
an
atf
charge
not
a
charge
that
would
come
from
pa
y
all
are
acting
like
he
has
a
deep
nuanced
knowledge
of
extradition
law
and
that
is
nonsense
a
lot
of
prosecutors
and
criminal
defense
lawyers
i
am
one
often
only
have
a
surface
level
understanding
of
extradition
because
it
is
typically
just
a
formality
that
most
defendants
waive
what
is
it
that
you
think
he
bought
time
to
accomplish
he
s
almost
certainly
not
getting
discovery
on
the
ny
cases
while
he
s
in
pa
he
has
been
charged
with
murder
in
new
york
if
he
hadn
t
been
charged
in
new
york
there
would
be
no
basis
for
extradition
y
all
stay
on
your
bullshit

ceo
shooting
news
valedictorian
and
all
around
nice
guy
snaps
due
to
severe
back
pain
and
our
horrendous
greed
infested
system
it
s
not
difficult
to
at
least
understand
where
he
is
coming
from
even
if
you
don
t
go
as
far
as
to
call
him
a
hero
definitely
went
mask
off
for
a
second
there
but
how
else
do
you
blow
a
dog
whistle
except
he
did
with
his
insurance
policies
452
people
have
died
since
he
was
shot
where
s
the
justice
for
them
brian
thompson
deserved
it
and
anybody
defending
him
can
feel
free
to
join
him
so
it
s
fine
if
you
do
it
in
a
suit
from
a
board
room
got
it
yeah
that
s
my
point
that
s
why
i
don
t
care
that
he
was
shot
the
dude
got
what
was
coming
to
him
is
it
bootlicking
still
if
he
s
deep
throating
the
boot
those
killed
by
the
spreadsheets
of
health
insurers
and
pe
firms
don
t
get
due
process
where
is
shapiro
in
this
article
pa
has
public
dockets
online
he
was
charged
with
forgery
firearms
not
to
be
carried
without
a
license
tampering
with
records
or
id
possession
of
instrument
of
a
crime
with
intent
and
false
identification
to
a
law
enforcement
officer
yeah
that
dude
has
no
idea
what
he
s
talking
about
thank
you
fellow
pa
gun
owner
that
actually
knows
what
they
re
talking
about
deleted
it
is
legal
to
make
and
own
a
3d
printed
gun
federally
and
in
pa
the
suppressor
would
be
a
federal
charge
as
they
are
restricted
by
the
nfa
requiring
a
200
tax
stamp
and
a
lengthy
paperwork
background
check
process
a
3d
printed
suppressor
could
be
legal
if
properly
registered
with
the
atf
which
is
almost
certainly
not
the
case
here
so
that
would
be
the
charge
the
ghost
gun
itself
while
illegal
in
new
york
is
perfectly
legal
in
pa
carrying
it
concealed
without
an
ltcf
license
to
carry
firearms
from
pa
or
from
a
state
that
pa
has
reciprocity
with
is
not
legal
hence
the
gun
charges
in
pa
no
i
m
not
acting
like
anything
the
dude
is
by
all
measures
a
highly
intelligent
guy
he
s
a
high
school
valedictorian
and
graduated
from
penn
and
one
could
reason
he
may
have
been
given
advice
to
be
taken
in
a
public
place
he
now
has
a
chance
to
get
his
story
out
there
too
the
court
of
public
opinion
will
make
a
big
difference
the
nypd
and
their
totally
incorruptible
mayor
may
not
have
allowed
him
to
reach
arraignment
he
not
only
gave
them
a
black
eye
but
he
allegedly
killed
something
worth
a
lot
of
money
and
the
first
rule
of
police
club
is
that
they
must
protect
the
money
and
its
friends
by
any
means
necessary
you
can
sympathize
with
anyone
if
you
know
their
story
but
he
s
absolutely
not
a
hero
he
s
wasted
potential
which
is
a
terrible
thing
to
be
at
such
a
young
age
how
is
that
mask
off
george
floyd
was
a
terrible
person
to
make
a
martyr
decent
people
don
t
put
a
gun
to
the
womb
of
a
pregnant
woman
if
brian
thompson
shot
someone
out
the
window
of
a
board
room
in
a
suit
he
d
be
in
jail
your
comment
was
about
government
support
for
extrajudicial
killing
the
incoming
president
clearly
has
no
issue
with
it
also
don
t
you
have
a
commonwealth
to
govern
or
some
donors
to
pander
to
why
are
you
here
this
is
one
i
know
particularly
well
i
was
buying
a
gun
a
few
years
back
in
southeast
pa
and
some
dude
came
back
after
selling
his
gun
to
the
ffl
the
day
before
he
was
borderline
experiencing
psychosis
called
the
cops
to
the
store
claiming
the
gun
was
still
in
his
name
while
my
background
check
was
going
through
the
ffl
and
cops
tried
for
like
30
minutes
to
explain
that
there
is
no
registry
of
firearms
in
pa
he
just
didn
t
get
it
this
shooter
probably
caught
a
firearms
charge
carrying
a
loaded
pistol
without
a
ccw
permit
or
illegally
owning
a
suppressor
probably
however
he
did
not
get
caught
having
an
unregistered
firearm
unless
it
s
some
niche
serial
number
issue
which
would
be
weird
because
people
build
p80s
in
pa
lawfully
aight
bro
i
understand
but
why
say
it
s
required
and
now
you
re
saying
you
couldn
t
remember
if
it
was
required
or
not
if
you
don
t
know
what
you
re
saying
is
accurate
don
t
contribute
to
the
conversation
ignorance
loves
a
good
conspiracy
theory
evidence
optional
i
agree
with
that
it
s
tragic
but
we
are
in
late
stage
capitalism
with
greed
infesting
everything
this
is
a
recipe
for
otherwise
good
people
to
lose
their
shit
the
rich
don
t
give
two
flying
fucks
when
they
poison
our
minds
bodies
and
mother
earth
the
media
doesn
t
seem
to
give
a
fuck
either
so
why
should
we
give
a
fuck
when
someone
who
inflicts
great
harm
on
the
people
gets
capped
i
m
glad
this
event
is
waking
people
up
that
the
fight
is
never
left
vs
right
but
top
vs
bottom
i
mean
isn
t
the
insurance
company
refusing
to
cover
his
needed
treatment
to
have
any
semblance
of
a
functioning
life
where
the
wasted
potential
for
luigi
originally
occurred
the
murder
happened
after
the
fact
the
guilt
behind
the
wasted
potential
as
you
put
it
lays
squarely
with
our
corrupt
profiterring
healthcare
system
not
luigi
you
ve
just
shown
us
it
s
better
than
being
a
waste
at
any
age
why
is
that
different
than
setting
policies
that
absolutely
verifiably
result
in
death
and
life
ruining
debt
seriously
stop
dodging
and
explain
the
logic
oh
jeez
that
sounds
like
a
nightmare
to
deal
with
agreed
on
the
charges
that
s
what
i
m
thinking
welcome
to
the
internet
we
are
in
the
moment
in
history
we
all
happen
to
live
greed
and
inequity
has
existed
long
before
late
stage
capitalism
was
even
a
thought
the
rich
have
always
prioritized
themselves
as
most
people
do
and
the
media
has
never
cared
to
call
them
out
yeah
i
thought
the
guy
was
going
to
go
postal
randomly
lol
per
the
nyt
before
he
was
charged
in
new
york
he
was
arraigned
in
blair
county
pa
where
he
was
charged
with
five
crimes
including
carrying
a
gun
without
a
license
forgery
falsely
identifying
himself
to
the
authorities
and
possessing
instruments
of
crime
according
to
the
criminal
complaint
no
charge
for
owning
a
3d
printed
gun
and
3d
printed
suppressor
and
or
illegally
owning
a
suppressor
i
d
assume
that
the
atf
would
charge
for
those
and
that
those
two
charges
would
not
be
in
pa
judisdiction
i
am
old
enough
to
remember
when
it
wasn
t
this
bad
we
ve
been
on
a
bad
slide
for
decades
and
the
balance
of
power
is
way
off
to
those
with
that
is
the
moment
we
are
living
in
and
as
a
result
you
will
see
more
people
pushed
to
the
brink
nostalgia
is
a
seductive
liar
social
media
has
changed
our
society
in
very
negative
and
substantial
ways
in
the
past
15
years
as
an
example
75
of
our
country
is
now
fat
vs
the
70
s
as
another
example
now
the
food
quality
is
one
i
ll
entirely
agree
on
you
should
be
growing
whatever
food
you
can
for
yourself
and
not
buy
farm
factory
meat
where
you
can
avoid
it
jury
selection
for
this
trial
is
going
to
be
a
shitshow
in
an
impromptu
news
conference
at
the
altoona
police
department
deputy
chief
derek
swope
said
that
they
are
investigating
threats
made
against
the
department
and
local
people
who
were
involved
in
the
arrest
this
is
clearly
a
very
polarized
case
we
have
received
some
threats
against
our
officers
and
building
here
we
ve
started
investigating
some
threats
here
against
some
citizens
in
our
community
we
re
taking
all
those
threats
seriously
and
doing
all
the
follow
up
we
can
with
those
derek
swope
deputy
chief
altoona
police
department
one
little
ceo
and
everyone
loses
their
minds
cops
interpret
everything
as
a
threat
a
guy
wrote
fuck
your
shitty
town
on
a
ticket
and
got
arrested
in
ny
for
threatening
going
to
need
a
whole
lot
more
than
his
word
maybe
if
they
can
t
handle
the
heat
they
shouldn
t
have
taken
the
job
it
s
what
libraries
schools
anf
children
s
hospitals
have
to
deal
with
all
the
time
doubt
they
probably
got
comments
of
fucking
snitches
or
class
traitors
on
their
facebook
page
when
they
posted
it
and
being
cops
interpret
that
shit
as
threats
hopefully
they
aren
t

we
finally
agree
on
something
and
they
want
cry
about
it
this
is
a
very
polarized
case
no
it
s
definitely
not

s

lol
boohoo
go
call
the

oh
wait
a

maybe
call

that

that
s

bad
anyway
how
much
snow
do
you
think
the

will
get
this

don
t
fuck
with
the
adjuster
my
baby
innocent
when
questioned
if
i
had
any
possible
issues
being
on
a
jury
i
said
i
was
the
daughter
of
a
nyc
cop
so
i
would
probably
be
judgey
i
figured
that
would
get
me
off
the
hook
it
didn
t
an
i
was
chosen
the
trial
was
a
man
of
color
who
was
caught
with
weed
not
guilty
i
would
love
to
b
back
in
nyc
and
on
luigi
s
jury
not
guilty
redditors
confirmed
if
ted
bundy
and
richard
ramirez
can
get
supporters
so
can
luigi
i
wonder
how
much
it
would
cost
to
have
a
banner
plane
circle
altoona
with
a
giant
sign
that
says
something
like
google
jury
nullification
pennsylvania
is
full
of
snitches
i
m
very
curious
to
know
some
notable
altoona
cold
cases
that
didn
t
get
a
fraction
of
the
department
attention
this
snatch
grab
got
cops
are
so
whiny
i
bet
cops
get
decent
healthcare
to
ensure
that
the
class
traitor
pigs
don
t
become
sympathetic
to
the
lowly
cash
pigs
good
if
this
is
true
and
it
wouldn
t
surprise
me
people
need
to
fucking
chill
out
the
cops
are
doing
their
job
holy
shit
luigi
s
in
the
system
now
don
t
give
the
cops
a
reason
to
get
rid
of
him
before
a
trial
we
get
it
nullification
now
stfu
before
they
realize
a
trial
will
not
work
good
that
s
what
you
get
for
being
class
traitors
i
really
hope
that
this
leads
to
more
uprising
i
don
t
know
if
we
deserve
any
positive
outcome
but
the
ruling
class
certainly
deserves
the
negative
good
good
first
off
no
one
wanted
this
man
caught
well
maybe
the
corporate
elites
and
shit
like
them
but
two
things
1
lets
move
onto
the
next
step
make
sure
that
anyone
who
is
on
jury
selection
for
the
next
few
months
try
and
get
on
the
case
purely
to
help
him
get
off
scott
free
2
go
figure
pa
police
are
able
to
do
the
job
of
the
nypd
nypd
are
not
exactly
great
at
their
job
they
have
an
arrest
record
of
47
in
2024
for
murder
but
diving
in
deeper
specifically
at
manhattan
where
this
happened
and
you
ll
find
that
the
rate
is
even
worse
38
okay
i
get
the
sentiment
but
don
t
you
folks
think
it
s
getting
a
bit
out
of
hand
now
are
we
really
picking
and
choosing
when
we
want
police
to
enforce
laws
because
that
s
a
real
slippery
slope
folks
the
vocal
majority
isn
t
always
right
and
you
re
opening
the
door
of
precedence
for
when
you
re
on
the
opposite
side
of
popular
opinion
if
you
want
to
enact
a
1
per
year
healthcare
ceo
trophy
policy
that
s
one
prerogative
but
creating
legal
ambiguity
because
of
feel
goods
and
told
ya
so
s
is
not
how
we
govern
shit
as
much
as
i
hate
insurance
companies
what
he
allegedly
did
was
premeditated
first
degree
murder
vigilantism
isn
t
what
we
are
about
in
this
country
or
at
least
shouldn
t
be
the
ceo
is
where
the
buck
stops
but
there
are
many
many
moving
parts
to
a
corporation
and
voters
who
support
politicians
who
allow
corporations
to
abuse
the
public
we
need
to
be
adults
about
this
no
one
is
batman
coming
to
save
us
politicians
should
hold
these
companies
accountable
correctly
there
should
be
a
standard
corporation
rule
book
to
be
a
good
citizen
of
the
community
first
shareholders
last
if
a
corporation
can
not
be
a
good
citizen
the
it
charted
should
be
killed
i
e
the
death
penalty
it
should
be
serious
if
the
say
they
have
first
amendment
rights
why
to
they
get
to
hurt
the
population
with
thier
greed
this
affects
everyone
but
the
1
ers
i
wish
the
congresscritters
would
uphold
this
good
they
did
their
job
got
a
criminal
off
the
street
i
mean
i
have
no
love
loss
for
the
united
health
guy
but
he
was
murdered
he
didn
t
deserve
that
maybe
he
committed
crimes
and
should
have
gone
to
jail
hopefully
the
truth
comes
in
this
pos
shooter
is
not
a
hero
boo
fucking
hoo
first
ol
dirty
bastard
at
a
mcdonalds
in
pa
now
this
mcsnitches
threatening
police
that
s
a
new
level
of
stupid
i
m
not
the
biggest
cop
fan
but
they
re
literally
just
doing
their
job
in
this
instance
the
good
news
is
they
are
being
threatened
by
a
bunch
of
losers
that
don
t
leave
their
parent
s
basement
what
s
with
people
these
days
as
an
aside
anyone
else
imagining
this
guy
sounding
like
mario
kart
i
m
a
luigi
number
one
uh
oh
we
know
it
doesn
t
take
much
for
officers
to
feel
threatened
and
when
they
feel
threatened
they
start
blastin
people
are
losing
their
mind
this
guy
is
no
hero
he
s
a
murderer
if
they
want
to
reform
health
insurance
they
should
vote
for
u
s
representatives
who
have
some
backbone
oh
no
so
anyway
what
s
going
on
this
weekend

they

threats
and
file
a
restraining
order
when
my
s
o
told
me
luigi
got
arrested
where
i
buy
my

oh
no
i
for
one
have
no
sympathy
in
fact
i
applaud
the
public
s
bravery
i
can
t
qwhite
figure
out
why
good
a
defendant
more
sympathetic
than
the
victim
could
present
a
problem
for
the
prosecution
threaten
the
police
dept
earth
really
is
teetering
on
its
axis
as
they
should
be
stuff
like
this
makes
it
worse
for
people
trying
to
improve
healthcare
by
normal
means
if
there
s
a
protest
rally
or
organized
gathering
at
a
meeting
or
event
and
participants
are
dressing
up
like
luigi
and
celebrating
him
no
way
in
hell
would
i
take
part
the
ones
with
normal
plans
protest
signs
legal
documents
and
such
may
end
up
having
to
wait
for
all
this
to
simmer
down
or
for
every
bit
of
dialogue
against
the
insurance
companies
they
have
to
do
5
times
as
much
to
speak
against
vigilantism
good
good
this
is
the
first
embers
of
the
roaring
revolution
coming
yup
there
s
psycos
everywhere
aww
those
poor
police
xd
good
i
don
t
think
even
for
a
second
anyone
in
apd
takes
the
threats
serious
not
even
slightly
or
they
are
lying
to
gin
up
sympathy
for
their
masters
oh
dear
maybe
they
should
call
the
police
and
see
what
type
of
response
time
they
will
get
given
they
feel
threatened
oh
now
the
cops
decide
to
actually
do
some
work
you
had
me
at
police
being
threatened

oh
no
did
they
think
that
law
enforcement
was
just
gonna
let
him
roam
the
streets
oh
no
anyway
are
they
gonna
uvalde
this
shit
out
too
so
many
morons
and
dirt
bags
think
this
rich
kid
is
a
hero
of
the
ppl
he
s
gonna
get
convicted
unless
the
jury
gets
stacked
with
leftists
i
bet
it
s
russia
making
the
threats
just
like
they
did
on
election
day
i
feel
sorry
for
him
not
the
ceo
of
greed
i
like
my
threats
the
same
way
i
like
my
booze
still
in
the
bottle
with
a
rag
and
some
fire
added
before
it
freely
flies
through
the
air
i
just
feel
sad
for
the
guy
because
now
his
whole
life
is
over
isn
t
it
he
s
going
to
spend
the
rest
of
his
life
in
prison
i
wonder
how
he
feels
about
it
he
s
already
being
painted
as
a
violent
leftist
by
fox
news
the
trump
administration
can
t
allow
this
to
continue
good
everyone
this
is
wrong
and
condemnable
they
re
doing
their
jobs
and
shouldn
t
be
harassed
and
threatened
luigi
is
a
hero
womp
womp
oh
no
anyways
good
that
mcdonalds
is
probably
catching
hell
too
the
whole
health
care
system
in
the
usa
is
shit
this
guy
had
back
problems
couldn
t
be
treated
in
a
timely
manner
and
it
got
in
his
head
constant
pain
will
do
that
by
the
time
insurance
companies
permit
a
procedure
is
months
of
agony
for
the
patient
it
s
ridiculous
you
can
bet
that
no
canadians
are
still
trying
for
procedures
here
anymore
no
point
i
would
say
it
s
good
for
police
to
be
humbled
but
they
are
already
afraid
of
everything
anyway
which
is
why
they
are
the
way
they
are
they
should
be
for
that
abomination
they
call
pizza
so
they
re
getting
dirty
looks
got
it
quick
call
the
po
wait
oh
i
know
i
m
not
the
only
person
that
is
glad
they
caught
the
sob
but
holy
hell
it
sure
seems
like
it
idc
what
your
politics
are
at
the
end
of
the
day
if
they
can
prove
he
s
the
one
that
did
it
he
needs
to
do
time
for
it
murder
is
murder
regardless
of
whether
you
re
pro
insurance
company
ceo
or
not
defense
will
have
an
uphill
battle
i
actually
think
this
guy
has
serious
mental
health
issues
based
on
this
radical
behavior
change
i
m
guessing
they
go
for
an
insanity
llea
what
if
biden
pardoned
him
can
he
legally
do
that
or
is
murder
not
up
for
pardons
good
good
the
police
state
needs
to
learn
fear
when
they
fo
after
a

he
will
have
a

legal
team
cops
are
absolute
fucking

i
can
t
believe
it
never
occurred
to
them
before
now
that
there
is
a
difference
between
americans
at
every
other
country
where
their
government
tried
to
take
over
all
the
people
s
rights
make
us
slaves
and
live
in
poverty
americans
have
the
second

there

thoughts

from
the
residents
of
springfield
ohio
i
think
the
most
interesting
thing
about
this
whole
situation
is
just
how
many
people
are
finding
out
how
tired
everyone
is
for
everyone
oh
my
god
how
can
you
be
happy
that
somebody
got
killed
there
are
1000
so
which
ceo
is
next
it
s
almost
like
eat
the
rich
started
out
as
a
joke
but
people
are
really
tired
of
being
treated
like
shit
good
he
performed
a
just
service
to
society
good
let
me
play
a
small
violin
for
them
police
threaten
people
all
the
time
no
sympathy
for
them
over
here
back
to
work
peasants
and
obey
your
masters
get
em
boys
the
brothers
of
nottingham
how
long
have
we
been
complaining
that
people
like
trump
can
get
away
with
everything
that
there
s
two
justice
systems
and
now
we
want
this
guy
to
get
away
with
murder
because
he
killed
someone
we
didn
t
like
i
get
the
sentiment
but
we
have
to
respect
the
rule
of
law
when
it
functions
as
it
should
he
ll
have
his
day
in
court
and
be
judged
by
his
peers
vigilantism
should
never
be
thought
of
as
a
way
to
bring
about
positive
change
in
a
civilized
society
would
you
feel
the
same
if
the
target
had
been
one
of
trump
s
enemies
of
the
state
or
would
you
want
the
rule
of
law
and
due
process
to
bring
accountability
you
guys
arrested
someone
who
will
go
down
as
a
golk
hero
you
should
expect
a
little
resistance
people
don
t
like
a
lot
of
people
you
can
t
going
around
killing
them
all
or
there
would
be
nobody
left
on
this
planet
plus
there
s
a
little
thing
called
laws
someone
should
call
the
police
oh
wait
they
should
have
the
tools
to
investigate
there
s
acorns
falling
on
the
roof
good
good
cops
are
shite
oh
noooo
but
they
re
cops
what
the
hell
are
they
worried
about
they
re
state
sanctioned
killers
they
could
just
go
cover
it
up
after
there
are
also
3
mcdonald
s
in
altoona
good
this
makes
no
sense
altoona
should
be
held
responsible
for
crimes
against
pizza
not
for
the
mangione
arrest
better
call
the
police
if
you
can
t
stand
the
heat
get
out
of
the
gulag
good
i
used
to
love
an
egg
mcmuffin
every
morning
sad
it
will
be
missed
we
are
just
doing
our
job
yeah
just
don
t
like
every
other
day
good
we
re
all
optimistic
about
this
but
i
feel
like
we
re
just
in
a
reddit
bubble
again
looks
like
mangione
is
100
correct
i
just
learned
that
trump
s
dr
oz
is
planning
to
replace
medicare
with
his
own
medicare
advantage
which
has
a
denial
rate
of
80
of
appeals
after
denials
this
is
far
worse
than
the
united
healthcare
denial
rates
this
billionaire
oligarch
arsefucking
of
americans
has
to
be
stopped
is
there
a
gofundme
for
this
i
think
we
all
should
chip
in
to
make
sure
that
he
is
protected
in
the
prison
from
corrupt
guards
who
might
bribe
prisoners
to
attack
him
i
couldn
t
care
less
the
fool
who
reported
luigi
should
know
no
rest
greed
knows
no
bounds
the
cops
were
just
doing
thier
jobs
police
are
being
threatened
good
that
s
what
happens
when
you
re
the
dogs
of
the
oligarchy
golly
welcome
to
the
america
you
guys
helped
create
oh
well
lot
of
acorns
falling
this
time
of
year
that
ceo
s
family
is
going
to
live
the
rest
of
their
lives
knowing
that
the
vast
majority
of
this
country
believes
that
he
deserved
to
die
i
get
why
the
guy
felt
motivated
to
do
it
murdering
the
ceo
is
not
the
answer
luigi
s
back
pain
will
not
get
any
better
laying
on
a
hard
bunk
every
day
but
altoona
police
department
is
a
great
pd
no
matter
how
you
feel
about
luigi
what
he
did
altoona
police
were
only
doing
there
jobs
cops
have
guns
and
qualified
immunity
a
literal
license
to
kill
good
oof
not
a
fan
of
this
i
get
that
cops
can
be
bastards
a
lot
of
them
but
at
the
end
of
the
day
they
are
the
working
class
too
and
it
is
their
job
they
have
to
do
just
like
we
have
to
still
work
for
billionaires
any
ideas
on
how
we
can
reroute
this
energy
to
make
billionaires
suffer
idk
maybe
doxing
them
and
sending
the
threats
their
way
i
just
don
t
want
to
see
anyone
in
the
working
class
get
targeted
even
if
they
are
against
the
movement
because
at
the
end
of
the
day
they
are
with
us
when
s
the
reverse
lynch
mob
where
we
break
into
the
jail
and
just
let
him
go
they
better
make
sure
the
jurors
are
not
all
retired
ceos
haha
someone
should
call
the
health
department
in
altoona
that
mcdonald
s
has
rats
thoughts
and
prayers
they
re
going
to
work
overtime
to
make
us
hate
his
guy
they
hate
that
he
has
become
a
sympathetic
figure
one
thing
this
tells
you
is
that
people
really
hate
the
health
insurance
industry
and
for
good
reason
if
only
our
politicians
had
our
best
intrests
in
mind
instead
of
their
pockets
there
is
a
real
movement
waiting
to
happen
to
get
us
universal
healthcare
someone

good
let
him
go
i
feel
like
anyone
who
doesn
t
like
criticism
just
claims
death
threats
these
days
bodycam
footage
or
it
never
happened
good
what
is
it
that
the
police
always
tell
people
who
are
threatened
they
say
they
can
t
do
anything
until
someone
follows
through
on
the
threat
so
they
can
just
sit
back
and
wait
like
everyone
else
while
the
police
do
nothing
to
help
and
sheriff
of
nottingham
says
he
s
being
threatened
after
arresting
robin
hood
haha
i
feel
like
this
is
gonna
be
the
tip
of
the
iceberg
for
the
fate
of
ceos
of
bullshit
corporations
what
are
the
sacklers
up
to
biden
needs
to
pardon
him
i
honestly
don
t
understand
what
he
did
wrong
acab
lots
of
misplaced
rage
here
despite
what
your
governor
says
this
wasn
t
cold
blooded
and
the
shooter
is
a
hero
it
s
disturbing
we
are
not
hearing
more
about
our
criminal
healthcare
system
ffs
only
blair
county
he
is
a
wanna
be
domestic
terrorist
so
are
his
supporters
acab
i
hope
everyone
dumb
enough
to
threaten
police
for
doing
their
job
and
arresting
a
cold
blooded
murderer
ends
up
in
their
own
jail
cells
for
making
terroristic
threats
just
because
this
whole
thing
is
so
stupid
also
anyone
making
threats
needs
to
end
up
on
a
special
list
to
be
further
investigated
because
they
clearly
aren
t
playing
with
a
full
deck
or
they
wouldn
t
threaten
the
people
who
have
the
resources
and
motivation
to
track
them
down
and
throw
them
in
jail

no

even
if

also
ps
don

it
will
not

for

i
need

understanding
this
whole

people
are
in
support
of
this
guy
who
shot
and
killed
a
ceo
i
don
t
watch
the
news
or
anything
so
that
s
all
i
understand
i
guess
people
don
t
like
the
ceo
because
he
s
rich
and
greedy
and
stuff
right
but
what
am
i
missing
that
would
make
the
vast
majority
of
people
think
that
killing
someone
in
cold
blood
is
the
right
thing
to
do
fantastic
lol
as
they
should
be
they
re
the
boot
of
the
rich
elite
paid
well
and
given
benefits
like
health
insurance
to
keep
their
fellow
non

in

fuck
em

though
he

not
a

if
the

i

just
change
their

to

they
were
able
to
seat
a

for
the

indictment
it
ll
be
a
long
process
but
it
ll
happen
no
it
wont
the
internet
thought
everyone
was
on
his
side
and
no
one
would
turn
him
in
yeah
there
s
people
who
googled
if
joe
biden
dropped
out
of
the
race
on
election
day
ny
city
will
have
no
issue
finding
12
people
who
arnt
familiar
with
this
story
they
ll
just
select
trump
supporters
they
re
clueless
about
everything
don
t
assume
the
social
media
reaction
to
this
matches
in
anyway
the
majority
opinion
when
i
saw
the
news
that
he
was
caught
i
walked
around
at
work
telling
people
and
everyone
was
glad
he
was
found
i
think
the
majority
of
people
in
the
world
consider
him
just
a
murderer
who
deserves
prison
jury
nullification
is
a
thing
too
this
is
literally
the
one
time
i
wouldn
t
say
i
m
afraid
i
can
t
be
impartial
your
honor
only
to
get
to
deliberations
and
refuse
to
say
anything
other
than
not
guilty
as
long
as
one
person
in
that
room
holds
out
it
s
good
enough
asking
every
juror
have
you
been
fucked
by
healthcare
in
anyway
it
really
depends
on
the
motive
that
comes
out
was
he
just
an
anarchist
nut
case
was
he
denied
care
during
his
back
operation
if
he
has
a
sympathetic
motive
then
that
will
sway
a
jury
i
feel
like
the
internet
is
a
little
bit
misled
i
think
it
s
a
different
story
with
the
old
people
that
typically
sit
on
juries
no
jury
is
going
to
let
this
rich
private
school
clown
slide
the
only
piece
of
evidence
the
police
don
t
have
is
a
note
saying
he
did
it
this
bitch
is
cooked
they
always
come
out
finding
people
under
some
rock
assuming
he
doesn
t
go
for
the
plea
bargain
though
with
everything
we
have
heard
so
far
i
do
not
expect
he
will
pursue
that
option
i
bet
they
will
look
for
ex
cops
or
people
that
work
in
government
positions
if
they
can
do
that
i
m
not
sure
oof
just
thought
of
that
when
the
question
have
you
ever
had
a
bad
experience
with
health
insurance
disqualifies
the
entire
jury
pool
i
was
going
to
say
guilty
but
a
guilty
verdict
requires
precertification
and
it
was
denied
what
jury
unless
he
tries
to
go
with
insanity
there
will
be
no
trial
there
is
no
mystery
here
they
got
the
gun
the
bullets
the
casings
his
written
motivation
confession
and
the
crime
is
recorded
on
video
and
there
is
likely
tons
of
other
forensic
evidence
we
don
t
even
know
about
yet
so
as
a
26
year
old
dude
facing
life
in
prison
without
parole
for
1st
degree
murder
he
will
mostly
likely
take
a
plea
deal
so
he
maybe
gets
out
of
jail
when
he
s
in
his
50s
or
60s
he
ll
take
that
deal
a
guy
used
to
private
school
and
ivy
league
and
hawaii
is
not
going
to
enjoy
the
facilities
while
he
is
held
without
bail
defend
handsome
italians
by
all
means
necessary
first
question
have
you
a
loved
one
family
member
or
friend
ever
been
to
your
knowledge
denied
a
medical
insurance
claim
it
ll
leave
like
3
people
in
the
state
they
should
probably
just
let
him
go
to
avoid
all
the
fuss
is
he
even
pleading
innocent
i
m
not
sure
he
s
going
to
plead
not
guilty
but
i
hope
he
does
because
he
definitely
didn
t
do
it
only
a
jury
of
ceos
will
convict
everyone
else
will
get
it
healthcare
ceos
to
be
specific
just
imagine
being
a
dumb
juror
and
the
guy
says
i
wanted
to
inflict
harm
on
the
health
insurance
industry
due
to
my
own
struggles
and
those
of
my
loved
ones
due
to
being
denied
claims
or
overcharged
by
insurance
and
you
d
probably
be
like
hmmmm
yeah
that
makes
a
lot
of
sense
i
live
in
manhattan
marble
hill
surrounded
by
basically
a
hood
with
plenty
of
folks
who
live
in
projects
and
they
are
the
best
people
i
know
i
am
looking
out
for
the
jury
notice
but
because
i
am
a
lawyer
i
would
have
to
disclose
that
no
matter
what
the
prosecution
s
evidence
i
would
vote
not
guilty
during
voire
dire
i
would
be
excused
good
they
ll
call
in
like
4000
people
to
narrow
it
down
to
twelve
remember
folks
if
they
ask
you
you
ve
never
heard
of
jury
nullification
and
are
only
going
to
use
the
facts
of
the
case
to
make
your
decision
wink
it
is
a
no
brainer
not
guilty
no
other
outcome
somehow
they
will
get
12
random
billionaire
ceo
juries
nah
there
are
just
some
fringe
weirdos
out
there
celebrating
this

isn

that
go

will
be

long
until

got
doxxed
i
would

never

that
for
only
ten
grand
the

they
signed
up

kind
of
thing
cops

let
s
be
fair
he
ran
one
of
the
world
s
top
insurance
companies
and
was
set
to
make
upwards
of
120m
this
year
there
s
nothing
little
about
this
man
or
the
role
he
played
in
this
industry
it
s
nobody
bats
an
eye
why
do
people
always
get
the
quote
wrong
i
managed
to
get
away
with
writing
highway
robbery
on
the
memo
line
of
a
check
i
wrote
to
the
pa
turnpike
earlier
this
year
at
least
when
the
bar
for
hiring
is
high
school
under
achiever
still
wanting
to
shove
people
into
lockers
you
re
not
going
to
get
the
best
also
maybe
they
shouldn
t
make
a
point
of
having
700
perp
walk
photos
if
they
don
t
want
to
deal
with
people
associating
them
with
the
arrest
it
truly
is
a
i
want
to
have
my
cake
and
eat
it
too
situation
because
they
have
no
issue
running
out
multiple
perp
walk
photo
ops
for
any
scenario
they
believe
will
give
them
positive
public
relations
essentially
publicly
dragging
people
before
any
conviction
of
a
crime
but
the
moment
that
backfires
they
re
like
well
this
sucks
they
re
literally
that
reaping
and
sowing
meme
perp
walks
are
fucking
gross
regardless
of
the
crime
and
are
intentionally
stoking
whatever
animalistic
thirst
for
mob
justice
people
seem
to
have
hardwired
into
them
hard
to
feel
bad
on
a
group
when
that
blows
up
in
their
face
or
maybe
people
should
stop
threatening
cops
hah
but
when
someone
says
that
to
anyone
else
they
cant
do
anything
about
it
i
got
threatened
by
a
squatter
in
a
house
i
was
selling
as
a
real
estate
agent
i
asked
for
a
police
escort
to
go
to
the
house
they
said
they
couldn
t
do
anything
for
me
and
most
likely
nothing
will
happen
i
was
actually
related
to
the
squatter
and
knew
his
hostory
he
is
a
felon
served
7
years
in
jail
for
international
drug
smuggling
between
countries
and
i
knew
he
had
a
gun
they
didn
t
care
doubt
yeah
needs
proof
or
it
didn
t
happen
i
have
a
fun
game
that
i
like
to
play
with
ultra
pro
police
people
i
ask
them
to
recall
the
last
time
they
read
or
heard
a
news
story
about
a
police
officer
s
food
being
tampered
and
then
i
ask
them
to
look
up
the
outcome
of
the
accusation
the
officer
made
i
have
yet
to
find
someone
who
can
name
an
incident
where
the
officer
wasn
t
either
mistaken
or
just
plain
lying
about
it
cops
constantly
lie
about
public
interactions
either
by
exaggeration
of
fabrication
i
completely
agree
i
don
t
think
anybody
would
be
dumb
enough
to
threaten
an
entire
police
department
they
read
them
with
their
hands
on
their
holsters
i
bet
to
the
folks
tasked
with
protecting
capital
over
people
those
are
threats
as
they
should
be
have
you
ever
heard
what
a
threat
sounds
like
have
you
or
your
family
or
workplace
ever
been
personally
threatened
they
don
t
give
a
damn
about
internet
social
media
trolls
you
d
think
a
person
with
a
12
year
old
account
would
be
aware
of
how
insane
poli
ical
radicals
are
on
this
very
website
jesus
man
the
guy
didn
t
do

settle
down
that
shit
is
nasty
lol
you
don
t
become
a
cop
because
you
re
brave
you
become
a
cop
to
gain
authority
because
they
know
that
of
all
of
us
decided
to
rise
up
they
d
be
out
numbered
100
to
1
maybe
because
they
are
serving
and
protecting
wrong
people
deleted
i
m
a
delivery
driver
and
my
job
is
substantially
more
dangerous
than
being
a
cop
but
you
don
t
hear
me
whining
they
are
not
they
just
take
every
opportunity
to
justify
their
later
use
of
excessive
force
if
you
had
a
legal
monopoly
on
extra
judicial
murder
you
would
be
defensive
too
for
the
same
reason
other
people
claim
weakness
or
victimhood
because
it
gives
them
impunity
cops
are
class
traitors
yeah
seems
to
me
like
generally
everybody
is
on
the
same
side
except
for
the
bootlickers
and
the
1
especially
on
reddit
thank
god
there
is
a
real

outside

on

is
it

then
the

why

does
anyone
know

guilty

people
who

destroying

so
you
want

ruin

while

i
don

it

reported
him

god
forbid
you
park
illegally
in

and
you
ll
have
20
cops
in

ass
in
seconds
it
s
going
to
be
a
ny
jury
but
if
it
somehow
magically
winds
up
being
in

i
will
do
my
best
to
be
a
juror
on
paper
i
never
had
any
denied
claims
and
actually
worked
for
a
health
insurer
when
i
was
young
and
working
for
the
health
insurer
is
why
i
hate
insurance
companies
lets
move
onto
the
next
step
make
sure
that
anyone
who
is
on
jury
selection
for
the
next
few
months
try
and
get
on
the
case
purely
to
help
him
get
off
scott
free
that
s
not
how
things
work
dummy
i
m
not
a
corporate
elite
and
i
wanted
him
caught
just
cause
i
m
black
and
we
go
to
jail
for
murder
i
think
water
should
be
free
but
you
don
t
see
me
killing
the
ceo
of
a
water
company
lock
his
dumb
ass
up
and
i
hope
he
don
t
think
people
in
jail
gonna
look
at
him
like
he
did
some
honorable
deed
scroll
through
some
of
the
comments
on
this
thread
alone
plenty
of
people
enjoy
the
taste
of
their
masters
boot
not
only
that
but
the
media
coverage
is
insane
they
re
really
leaning
on
the
fact
that
this
man
wasn
t
just
some
loser
with
a
gun
but
an
ivy
league
educated
man
from
a
well
off
family
with
a
great
upbringing
it
s
almost
like
they
re
shocked
he
wasnt
some
poor
scumbag
they
re
even
claiming
he
was
working
off
of
a
manifesto
which
to
me
just
comes
off
as
the
same
tired
old
trick
of
bad
man
with
gun
crazy
killer
they
throw
at
us
when
some
poor
bastard
finally
snaps
and
lashes
out
i
m
not
even
an
anarchist
type
and
this
story
brought
a
smile
to
my
face
all
of
the
details
rich
white
well
educated
and
still
fucked
by
the
system
used
his
intelligence
and
executed
a
near
perfect
plan
for
revenge
probably
didn
t
care
if
he
got
caught
if
the
information
about
his
medical
situation
is
true
facing
life
altering
medical
issues
with
no
help
would
break
anybody
i
doubt
i
d
be
worried
about
my
future
if
that
was
me
quite
frankly
with
how
the
world
has
been
slowly
tearing
itself
asunder
ive
been
wondering
how
long
before
we
started
seeing
people
snap
and
lose
their
shit
that
don
t
fit
the
average
joe
title
i
never
condone
murder
except
paul
vernon
i
m
fine
with
him
being
caught
if
this
is
anything
a
ploy
to
get
attention
running
would
have
done
nothing
thsi
will
be
buried
under
the
rug
cause
americans
don
t
really
care
they
say
they
do
but
don
t
want
to
do
what
s
necessary
to
make
changes
more
like
the
vocal
minority
reddit
isn
t
reflective
of
the
population
as
a
whole
don
t
count
on
the
vast
majority
of
people
on
here
to
be
able
to
understand
that
this
is
a
natural
consequence
of
a
society
that
creates
a
lot
of
angry
people
how
do
you
expect
whining
about
it
to
make
it
better
you
clearly
have
no
idea
how
much
influence
the
wealthy
have
they
can
make
things
better
at
any
time
if
the
public
option
hadn
t
been
removed
from
the
aca
the
guy
would
probably
still
be
alive
why
not
blame
the
health
insurance
lobbyists
wagging
your
finger
at
the
least
powerful
is
so
ignorant
if
conditions
are
created
that
lead
to
a
lot
of
angry
people
some
of
those
people
will
be
violent
due
to
the
large
sample
your
moralizing
will
not
make
a
difference
only
a
change
in
the
conditions
will
since
you
re
so
afraid
blame
the
people
who
let
it
get
to
this
point
it
didn
t
happen
overnight
they
can
begin
an
honest
conversation
and
start
encouraging
changes
at
any
point
if
there
is
mass
unrest
most
of
the
billionaires
will
be
safe
how
much
thought
do
you
think
they
would
give
to
your
well
being
as
they
consider
their
options
based
on
how
you
re
handling
this
the
ruling
class
can
be
confident
that
you
ll
blame
everyone
but
them
does
that
incentivize
them
to
give
in
to
change
that
significantly
weakens
them
or
should
they
just
sit
back
in
a
safe
place
while
people
die
it
s
not
like
you
ll
blame
them
you
ll
just
pointlessly
moralize
the
various
political
positions
that
the
majority
of
this
country
has
wanted
as
shown
in
polling
have
not
been
enacted
by
our
government
how
long
does
that
need
to
happen
before
the
people
rise
up
and
decide
to
do
something
about
it
if
the
government
isn
t
working
you
create
a
new
government
that
was
how
this
country
is
founded
and
it
s
the
direction
we
need
to
go
in
the
only
people
the
government
is
working
for
is
the
1
vigilantism
is
how
this
country
was
founded
well
the
government
won
t
do
shit
so
it
s
up
to
us
to
take
our
country
back
i
m
going
to
go
schizo
for
a
second
but
bear
with
me
the
insurance
services
office
writes
the
policies
that
company
is
a
subsidiary
of
verisk
the
ceo
of
verisk
is
lee
shavel
mr
shavel
here
use
to
be
executive
vice
president
and
chief
financial
officer
of
nasdaq
all
i
m
saying
is
this
is
the
biggest
conflict
of
interest
i
ve
ever
seen
and
i
think
luigi
got
the
wrong
ceo
this
is
why
vigilante
justice
is
wrong
we
re
out
of
options
violence
is
the
last
resort
but
it
is
a
resort
it
s
just
the
last
one
do
we
really
think
that
voting
in
the
next
politician
will
have
any
effect
on
stopping
the
health
insurance
nightmare
plaguing
our
country
they
will
be
bought
and
sold
before
the
election
even
ends
it
s
not
like
we
haven
t
been
waiting
for
a
good
solution
from
the
people
we
put
in
charge
they
are
why
it
s
been
allowed
to
get
as
far
as
it
has
it
s
been
decades
they
aren
t
here
for
us
you
re
right
it
is
murder
and
it
will
happen
again
thankfully
seems
to
me
like
everything
else
we
ve
tried
hasn
t
worked
they
elected
a
fucking
felon
remember
the
french
revolution
lugi
s
pronouns
are
he
him
i
don
t
know
if
i
d
call
it
his
job
seems
like
it
s
more
of
a
fun
hobby
cleaning
the
streets
with
criminals
he
did
his
job
cleaned
the
earth
of
a
parasite
oh
he
s
a
pos
the
other
is
a
united
healthcare
guy
the
ceo
was
the
pos
and
how
many
people
did
the
ceo
murder
with
his
shit
policies
we
as
a
society
need
to
reevaluate
what
murder
is
because
health
insurance
execs
kill
more
people
than
any
serial
killer
if
those
rich
fucks
actually
ever
went
to
jail
we
might
not
have
to
resort
to
violence
but
they
don
t
ever
ok
bootlicker
fuck
you
shill
you
and
i
both
know
a
healthcare
ceo
will
never
see
the
inside
of
a
cell
don
t
be
delusional
not
that
new
y
all
queda
has
been
threatening
law
enforcement
for
years
while
somehow
still
saying
they
back
the
blue
the
police
only
went
in
because
it
was
a
mcdonalds
and
not
a
school
i
bet
they
have
a
great
collection
of
funko
pops
down
there
but
they
did
not
name
the
people
you
want
us
to
vote
for
also
alleged
murderer
i
be
more
inclined
to
believe
it
if
he
gets
convicted
but
in
the
us
you
re
innocent
until
proven
guilty
what
a
delusional
take
time
to
grow
up
peter
they
definitely
want
an
excuse
to
harm
luigi
they
need
all
eyes
on
trump
thats
why
they
want
this
to
go
away
as
soon
as
possible
its
been
flooded
with
complaints
not
to
mention
back
problems
depending
what
it
is
is
often
not
easily
treatable
it
can
also
worsen
the
condition
i
have
been
in
forums
where
people
had
surgery
and
dint
alleviate
any
symptoms
because
the
spine
is
such
a
delicate
area
its
hard
to
operate
on
it
without
damaging
some
vital
part
eh
i
feel
like
this
is
a
reddit
social
media
thing
i
know
no
one
in
the
real
world
that
is
celebrating
this
guy
people
who
are
really
need
a
reality
check
it
s
ok
to
say
healthcare
is
broken
and
needs
fixed
and
also
acknowledge
what
this
guy
did
is
wrong
these
people
do
not
even
think
through
what
they
type
imagine
if
it
became
ok
to
just
kill
anyone
you
don
t
like
bc
you
ve
been
wronged
or
are
in
pain
or
that
person
is
rich
etc
etc
it
s
all
good
until
someone
perceives
you
or
yours
as
the
bad
guy
and
feels
their
motives
are
justified
it
s
honestly
gross
and
disheartening
but
it
s
honestly
the
kind
of
take
that
s
100
expected
from
reddit
that
only
helps
him
more
even
if
he
could
he
wouldn
t
he
can
t
though
presidents
can
only
pardon
federal
crimes
they
are
particular
porcine
variety
gfm
prohibits
that
i
believe
i
think
there
are
other
funding
sites
they
are
more
corrupt
than
ceos
they
have
to
be
they
get
away
with
murder
all
the
time
you
know
who
they
serve
people
like
the
ceo
not
plebs
like
luigi
it
s
important
to
remember
that
a
civilized
society
presumes
everyone
innocent
until
proven
guilty
there
is
nothing
0
evidence
that
conclusively
says
luigi
did
it
and
he
plead
not
guilty
we
don
t
even
know
if
they
re
going
to
be
able
to
extradite
him
to
new
york
with
what
they
have
we
should
be
pushing
the
altoona
courts
to
post
bail
for
him
immediately
they
use
the
excuse
of
they
are
afraid
for
thier
lives
so
they
shoot
people
all
the
time
if
trump
can
get
away
with
crime
mangione
should
be
able
to
too
now
we
all
have
to
make
sure
both
the
guards
and
prisoners
make
sure
that
he
is
not
harmed
in
prison
we
re
all
domestic
terrorists
i
wouldn
t
say
he
was
a
wanna
be
lol
when
this
country
eventually
sees
civil
war
which
side
are
you
going
to
be
on
in
case
you
ve
been
living
under
a
rock
we
aren
t
just
heading
towards
it
we
are
running
towards
it
at
a
breakneck
pace
removed
by
reddit
why
do
you
feel
he
is
innocent
he
created
ai
to
decide
who
lives
and
who
dies
not
even
a
real
person
just
a
computer
his
company
made
billions
last
year
and
had
a
32percent
denial
rate
highest
healthcare
numbers
the
asshole
got
a
ten
million
dollar
bonus
for
those
numbers
those
numbers
are
suffering
people
just
cause
you
don
t
shoot
someone
doesn
t
make
it
any
less
evil
he
killed
people
to
get
a
bonus
he
had
blood
on
his
hands
cops
are
paid
well
lol
phili
has
the
highest
average
salary
of
62k
a
year
altoona
is
not
paying
them
even
that
and
that
is
for
full
time
smaller
poor
towns
often
have
them
part
time
and
pay
them
even
less
first
responders
in
general
are
paid
fuck
all
my
brother
is
ems
and
he
can
get
more
money
working
retail
than
being
a
trained
paramedic
actually
know
wtf
you
are
saying
before
spewing
it
out
yet
if
something
bad
is
happening
to
you
who
do
you
call
to
help
or
save
you
way
to
tell
the
world
you
don
t
understand
basic
concepts
new
york
doesn
t
have
the
death
penalty
and
nobody
uses
the
electric
chair
anymore
but
there
are
millions
of
freaks
who
actually
like
trump
it
s
pretty
non
partisan
that
people
dont
like
health
insurance
ceos
even
in
the
right
griftosphere
where
they
ll
use
accept
any
right
wing
talking
points
the
people
are
pushing
back
against
the
narrative
health
insurance
ceo
good
the
only
panel
that
would
convict
is
a
jury
of
millionaires
and
ceos
hopefully
they
can
delay
it
so
long
that
by
then
he
can
say
he
s
launching
his
presidential
campaign
we
can
t
arrest
anyone
running
for
president
anymore
right
i
volunteer
as
tribute
not
if
americans
vote
him
into
the
presidency
first
the
dude
is
one
of
the
few
things
drawing
america
together
if
fox
doesn
t
or
cant
mobilize
it
s
audience
against
something
they
too
suffer
against
there
s
a
good
chance
dude
walks
i
ll
do
it
im
super
unbiased
i
swear
that
s
why
hes
walking
free
half
the
jury
selection
were
trump
supporters
trump
is
pretty
universally
hated
in
ny
and
yet
that
piece
of
shit
racist
felon
child
molester
got
re
elected
trump
got
convicted
eventually
defense
ran
out
of
strikes
this
will
be
the
opposite
problem
everyone
and
their
brother
on
his
side
and
it
only
takes
one
you
just
countered
the
statement
with
an
example
of
a
shitshow
i
m
not
a
gambler
but
if
fanduel
allowed
it
as
a
prop
bet
i
d
put
up
money
that
luigi
mangione
will
not
be
allowed
an
opportunity
to
speak
in
a
courtroom
no
fucking
way
the
american
oligarchs
allow
this
man
to
speak
in
open
court
they
didn
t
allow
ted
kaczynski
to
to
testify
they
won
t
let
luigi
would
you
nutswingers
stop
comparing
everything
to
trump
for
christ
s
sake
you
people
are
annoying
about
it
all
already
we
get
it
you
don
t
like
trump
he
grabbed
your
pussy
boo
hoo
just
accept
it
and
move
on
biden
isn
t
a
saint
either
he
s
one
of
the
biggest
hypocrites
ever
nah
you
just
need
a
jury
of
moderate
democrats
they
re
always
trying
to
prove
they
ll
lick
boots
and
love
it
of
peers
i
dunno
of
white
boomers
that
think
this
is
their
shot
at
the
american
dream
most
likely
that
s
not
how
jury
selection
works
have
you
ever
had
a
bad
experience
with
health
insurance
uh
huh
yes
oh
i
see
ok
these
thirty
jurors
are
excused
how
familiar
are
you
with
jury
selection
familiarity
with
the
story
is
only
a
portion
of
what
goes
into
selection
for
example
if
there
s
a
trial
where
a
cop
is
the
defendant
jurors
are
going
to
be
asked
about
how
they
view
law
enforcement
whether
they
trust
them
or
not
and
so
on
they
ll
be
chosen
or
disqualified
based
on
those
answers
my
partner
was
disqualified
once
because
she
was
asked
if
she
was
able
to
trust
a
cop
s
word
and
recollection
of
events
and
she
said
no
jurors
here
are
going
to
be
asked
plenty
of
unrelated
things
they
re
absolutely
going
to
be
screened
for
biases
against
insurance
companies
and
or
rich
people
lots
of
weird
unrelated
questions
are
going
to
get
asked
and
regarding
no
one
would
turn
him
in
one
person
did
and
it
took
several
days
nobody
else
said
a
word
and
his
face
was
plastered
everywhere
that
whole
time
while
this
guy
was
riding
busses
wearing
the
same
jacket
he
was
when
he
shot
the
guy
yes
let
s
all
say
it
together
folks
social
media
is
not
real
life
this
is
exactly
it
reddit
and
many
online
spaces
are
in
full
support
of
him
but
many
are
against
him
and
many
people
care
much
less
ive
never
met
an
american
that
didnt
have
a
medical
billing
complaint
story
tell
us
you
don
t
know
how
jury
selection
works
without
telling
us
you
don
t
know
how
jury
selection
works
lol
that
stat
about
google
includes
people
who
looked
up
when
did
joe
biden
drop
out
probably
low
info
people
some
people
dont
read
the
news
and
only
heard
shot
and
killed
a
ceo
not
the
story
behind
it
they
also
dont
want
to
public
admit
they
support
murder
as
well
but
super
rare
any
decent
prosecutor
is
going
to
make
sure
by
the
time
the
jury
is
empaneled
it
will
be
comprised
of
12
people
who
won
t
unanimously
vote
against
the
facts
getting
12
strangers
to
make
some
concerted
political
statement
or
doing
it
for
the
memes
is
just
not
that
likely
i
too
watch
movies
and
tv
jury
nullification
is
pointless
when
there
s
going
to
be
a
directed
verdict
not
so
sure
old
people
deal
with
insurance
more
than
anyone
i
think
they
have
a
3
page
note
they
said
luigi
was
carrying
the
fully
assembled
3d
printed
pistol
silencer
attachment
in
his
backpack
along
with
a
fake
passport
the
clothes
he
was
wearing
on
the
day
of
the
murder
and
foreign
money
altoona
pn
where
the
mcdonalds
is
located
is
about
4
hours
from
manhattan
so
he
supposedly
took
5
days
to
travel
4
hours
westward
instead
of
going
northbound
to
the
canadian
border
which
would
have
taken
6
hours
from
manhattan
even
though
3d
printed
objects
can
be
melted
into
slop
in
any
microwave
in
about
10
minutes
and
pennsylvania
has
an
enormous
number
of
bodies
of
water
which
one
could
throw
shit
into
loads
of
mountains
to
bury
evidence
in
but
luigi
chose
to
carry
that
shit
on
his
back
for
5
days
uh
huh
sure
thats
probably
what
they
are
looking
for
mostly
retired
people
that
can
be
swayed
or
people
that
dont
read
the
news
there
are
alot
of
both
of
those
groups
or
people
that
wont
question
authorities
at
all
leos
lawyers
are
almost
always
struck
for
jury
selection
no
chance
the
defence
lawyer
will
have
them
struck
from
the
list
also
people
who
are
phd
some
scientists
too
even
the
ones
that
had
good
insurance
had
greviences
against
it
you
see
but
the
rich
demands
justice
since
they
caught
him
so
fast
they
need
to
make
an
example
out
of
him
to
make
it
quickly
go
away
so
they
can
go
back
to
distracting
people
with
trump
and
culture
war
bs
60k
50k
from
fbi
but
the
snitch
will
never
see
a
penny
of
that
money
i
am
more
and
more
convinced
that
the
cops
used
some
kind
of
surveillance
that
violates
the
law
and
so
they
re
coming
up
with
a
bullshit
story
about
the
employee
snitching
the
story
is
that
the
employee
noticed
luigi
had
a
bunch
of
fraudulent
ids
but
when
is
the
last
time
you
had
to
pull
out
your
id
at
mcdonalds
and
how
the
fuck
would
an
average
person
know
what
a
fraudulent
id
looks
like
from
a
distance
his
picture
was
on
tv
her
name
has
already
been
posted
on
the
internet
you
re
assigning
a
mc
donald
s
employee
a
lot
of
mental
gymnastics
they
likely
don
t
have
capacity
to
perform
i
d
wager
a
bet
that
person
didn
t
even
give
a
moments
thought
about
what
happens
after
it
s
not
something
they
need
to
be
skilled
at
to
perform
their
task
the
thought
of
getting
50k
is
likely
life
changing
in
their
mind
but
not
for
the
reasons
you
think
more
like
i
can
buy
a
car
now
to
be
clear
i
agree
i
d
have
probably
dismissed
it
and
moved
on
with
life
and
not
say
anything
the
snitch
and
the
boomer
who
reporter
them
probably
someones
going
to
find
out
who
works

my
dad
wrote
not
guilty
on
the
memo
of
a
check
paying
a
parking
ticket
3
states
away
once
8
years
later
he
got
caught
speeding
in
the
same
state
and
when
the
cops
did
the
lic
reg
thing
he
came
up
as
put
in
cop
car
stat
somehow
he
had
a
charge
for
avoiding
trial
i
am
not
a
lawyer
or
something
as
the
not
guilty
was
interpreted
as
a
plea
every
year
when
i
pay
my
property
tax
i
write
extortion
on
the
memo
line
i
have
never
been
helped
by
a
cop
ever
they
ll
make
any
excuse
to
not
do
anything
even
when
someone
is
threatening
to
murder
you
with
a
gun
it
s
weird
that
someone
can
move
in
to
your
house
while
you
re
at
work
and
if
they
make
a
fake
lease
agreement
it
s
pretty
much
legally
their
house
at
that
point
unless
you
have
thousands
upon
thousands
for
lawyers
america
is
broken
isn
t
all
international
drug
smuggling
between
countries
but
but
but
they
said
shake
shack
did
this
we
should
believe
them
over
all
the
evidence
that
it
didn
t
happen
do
they
still
got
mama
s
a
lot
of
them
are
people
who
wanted
to
join
the
military
but
were
afraid
of
the
possibility
that
the
other
side
can
shoot
back
are
you
talking
about
those
people
that
have
to
wear
cameras
because
they
lie
so
often
i
was
a
delivery
driver
and
my
job
was
substantially
less
dangerous
than
a
cops
what
are
you
delivering
and
what
makes
you
say
that
you
think
everyone
is
just
cool
with
the
idea
that
we
should
let
people
get
gunned
down
in
the
streets
if
we
decide
they
re
part
of
our
problems
gotta
throw
fetterman
and
shapiro
in
with
the
boot
lickers
sad
to
say
but
i
guess
they
ve
been
bought
and
paid
for
too
isn
t
luigi
in
the
1
correct
luigi
was
a
gentle
giant
they
do
it
all
the
time
when
the
victim
is
a
minority
or
poor
i
wonder
what
s
different
this
time
oh
you
poor
soul
i
m
an
acab
person
so
based
on
that
info
what
do
you
think
my
response
will
be
the
wealthy
demand
it
one
of
thier
own
was
killed
by
a
pleb
also
they
dont
want
to
be
the
next
target
themselves
since
they
are
the
source
of
bs
culture
wars
to
distract
from
the
actual
class
wars
because
he
s
not
well
mentally
nor
is
he
some
legendary
clever
assassin
he
s
a
dumb
kid
who
got
lucky
because
of
his
audacity
that
s
it
dude
really
wanted
a
hash
brown
lol
mo
ron
every
rich
person
destroys
lives
will
you
pull
the
trigger
or
even
throw
a
punch
no
so
many
tough
guys
on
reddit
now
you
sound
like
a
snitch
i
m
definitely
not
dumb
enough
to
say
i
m
willing
to
do
dumb
stuff
on
the
internet
the
word
uprising
being
used
as
a
verb
here
allows
a
lot
of
latitude
for
an
individual
to
do
things
that
would
not
ruin
their
life
kudos
to
all
that
participate
in
trying
to
make
the
world
more
fair
sure
but
the
news
is
reporting
that
he
was
extradited
which
means
that
he
was
arrested
and
held
by
the
pa
police
and
lets
be
honest
did
you
really
think
that
nypd
would
come
to
pa
to
arrest
him
that
s
a
bit
far
outside
the
manhattan
jurisdiction
lol
do
we
know
the
man
of
that
dude
or
jump
a
subway
turnstile
that
s
literally
a
death
sentence
hell
face
murder
gun
dvading
and
eluding
etc
in
ny
in
pa
he
ll
face
gun
charges
and
will
be
tried
after
ny
is
done
with
him
surprisingly
enough
it
actually
is
if
you
answer
the
selection
questions
to
the
prosecutor
and
defense
satisfaction
during
selection
and
then
refuse
to
convict
theyll
walk
free
it
s
called
jury
nullification
and
its
perfectly
legal
but
talking
about
it
in
a
courtroom
isnt
for
some
reason
weird
quirk
from
slavery
days
as
are
most
things
in
american
politics
how
many
jury
duties
have
you
been
to
i
ve
been
to
7
you
can
absolutely
do
this
mostly
answer
the
prosecution
and
defense
questions
in
a
way
that
they
are
more
likely
to
pick
you
and
it
works
surpisingly
well
you
might
want
to
look
into
something
called
jury
nulification
because
it
s
an
actual
thing
that
happens
often
and
is
very
much
legal
it
s
kind
of
like
fight
club
where
you
can
t
talk
about
fight
club
and
houses
in
2
different
states
i
m
not
even
in
philly
rn
i
get
paid
directly
from
insurance
companies
you
a
worker
i
got
workers
we
different
and
stop
trying
to
go
back
and
forth
before
ya
boss
catch
you
and
don
t
nobody
that
stand
outside
on
27th
st
got
more
money
than
me
clearly
a
man
of
the
people
you
re
not
supposed
to
deep
throat
the
whole
boot
i
mean
if
you
don
t
think
white
people
go
to
jail
for
murder
then
that
s
a
whole
different
topic
but
i
would
like
to
say
that
a
lot
of
them
definitely
do
it
s
just
when
you
re
rich
or
conservative
you
can
use
the
corrupt
party
to
fund
your
defense
you
don
t
see
me
killing
the
ceo
of
a
water
company
do
you
know
the
ceo
of
a
water
company
because
i
personally
don
t
and
i
would
feel
the
same
way
about
a
ceo
for
water
as
i
do
about
the
ceo
of
uhc
he
don
t
think
people
in
jail
gonna
look
at
him
like
he
did
some
honorable
deed
i
don
t
think
anyone
thinks
that
damn
way
to
weazel
your
race
into
something
that
was
nothing
to
do
with
it
right
but
this
is
unfortunately
exceeding
reddit
now
that
s
the
part
that
s
scaring
me
exactly
nuance
is
fucking
lost
on
the
world
we
got
goddamn
nazis
on
our
bridges
and
people
praising
murder
in
the
streets
social
justice
epenises
everywhere
you
turn
it
s
insufferable
jfc
that
s
why
these
same
people
lost
the
election
stop
talking
to
me
like
i
m
12
and
have
no
idea
what
s
going
on
in
the
world
and
start
explaining
to
me
why
it
s
okay
to
chastise
police
for
apprehending
the
suspect
of
a
murder
and
do
it
like
a
goddamn
adult
this
time
get
to
it
then
see
ya
on
the
news
get
to
it
then
see
ya
on
the
news
the
affordable
care
act
would
disagree
yeah
remember
the
reign
of
terror
that
followed
shortly
after
you
know
the
reign
of
terror
that
saw
almost
50
000
supposed
counter
revolutionaries
executed
only
to
find
out
that
the
majority
were
innocent
civilians
and
that
gave
rise
to
napoleon
that
french
revolution
and
how
many
people
did
the
ceo
murder
with
his
shit
policies
even
nazis
had
a
day
in
court
people
on
reddit
think
life
is
like
a
disney
movie
where
you
defeat
the
villain
and
suddenly
the
sky
is
blue
and
birds
are
chirping
again
they
ll
just
hire
more
security
at
our
expense
it
s
not
just
the
ceo
it
s
the
entire
for
profit
medical
system
that
is
our
government
s
fault
they
sold
us
out
to
greedy
corporations
many
years
ago
murdering
a
ceo
changes
nothing
really
so
cold
blooded
murder
is
ok
i
could
see
if
the
guy
was
hitler
yes
i
stand
corrected
accused
murderer
delusional
and
how
do
you
think
positive
change
has
occurred
in
the
usa
whether
laws
against
child
labor
the
creation
of
social
security
voting
rights
or
compensation
for
exposure
of
our
soldiers
to
toxic
burn
pits
the
answer
is
clear
through
the
hard
work
of
gaining
support
for
legislation
if
you
think
random
assassinations
are
the
way
to
promote
social
change
i
don
t
know
how
you
reconcile
that
with
living
in
a
constitutional
republic
believing
the
two
are
compatible
strikes
me
as
delusional
and
that
is
not
to
say
i
defend
united
having
a
claim
denial
rate
twice
the
national
average
speaks
to
their
priorities
of
course
people
are
angry
but
murder
is
not
the
answer
absolutely
he
hasn
t
been
proven
guilty
of
anything
how
do
you
expect
anyone
to
take
you
seriously
with
your
dumb
ass
emojis
not
the
fucking
cops
i
can
promise
you
that
if
i
need
help
and
i
m
in
an
emergency
they
are
the
last
person
i
d
call
save
you
cops
are
unlikely
to
save
you
regardless
of
what
you
think
of
them
if
someone
came
into
your
house
and
wanted
to
murder
you
would
they
really
get
there
in
time
cops
investigate
crime
and
deliver
people
to
the
judiciary
to
ensure
they
re
held
accountable
showing
that
there
are
consequences
disincentivizing
similar
behavior
from
others
police
defenders
all
seem
to
have
a
childish
conception
of
how
things
work
a
kindergartner
who
just
had
a
cop
give
a
talk
in
class
would
say
the
same
thing
it
s
interesting
just
say
i
don
t
understand
makes
you
look
a
lot
less
stupid
while
i
applaud
your
optimism
i
d
wager
my
life
savings
that
he
gets
convicted
lucky
for
me
if
i
lose
i
m
already
broke
go
check
any
thread
related
to
this
guy
on
r
conservative
they
hate
him
over
there
and
call
the
left
nuts
for
cheering
on
a
criminal
lol
the
people
are
pushing
back
against
the
narrative
health
insurance
ceo
good
i
don
t
think
that
s
the
big
impediment
people
seem
to
think
it
is
the
ceo
doesn
t
need
to
be
good
to
be
the
victim
of
an
unlawful
killing
juries
every
day
convict
shitty
people
of
murdering
other
shitty
people
it
s
gonna
be
a
surprise
to
a
lot
of
people
when
the
jury
easily
convicts
him
lol
mark
my
words
it
s
going
to
be
made
out
he
s
gay
or
something
and
they
ll
find
the
most
homophones
rednecks
and
push
the
whole
thing
endlessly
as
he
was
woke
lgbt
or
mid
level
corporate
managers
who
have
delusions
of
three
letter
abbreviations
after
their
names
i
d
love
to
sit
on
this
jury
just
remember
that
the
poor
stupid
schmuck
who
turned
him
in
probably
only
makes
minimum
wage
we
have
an
insane
bootlicking
problem
in
this
country
just
because
they
like
ceo
doesn
t
mean
they
ll
condone
murder
lots
of
people
just
think
murder
bad
and
don
t
understand
nuance
nah
from
what
i
ve
seen
conservatives
are
really
upset
that
the
ceo
got
murdered
this
dude
is
gonna
hang
and
being
italian
non
white
isn
t
going
to
help
him
i
d
argue
that
many
of
the
regular
ceos
even
hate
the
health
insurance
ceos
this
a
day
after
a
white
veteran
was
let
free
by
a
jury
for
killing
a
black
man
on
the
subway
that
s
like
saying
people
of
color
won
t
vote
for
trump
yet
here
we
are
why
did
so
many
poor
white
people
become
trumps
base
it
s
projection
this
is
a
rich
so
and
so
and
they
think
they
can
sit
at
the
table
not
gonna
happen
true
walsh
and
shaprio
both
got
backlash
from
their
audiences
after
they
tried
defending
the
ceo
basically
i
wish
i
live
around
a
bunch
of
overpaid
dolts
they
worship
the
rich
and
immoral
these
are
the
christians
who
work
60
hours
a
week
but
still
think
they
are
more
like
musk
and
trump
than
you
and
me
that
s
an
odd
rebuttal
though
because
for
trump
trial
they
weren
t
trying
to
find
a
jury
of
people
who
like
or
dislike
him
they
were
trying
to
find
a
non
partisan
and
unbiased
jury
without
a
strong
opinion
on
him
so
your
counter
to
the
point
about
trump
doesn
t
make
much
sense
tbh
which
is
truly
weird
and
hypocritical
given
the
far
right
and
now
the
frgop
have
done
everything
in
their
power
to
kill
health
care
reform
no
my
parents
definitely
would
i
tried
to
explain
to
explain
to
my
dad
why
people
are
mad
at
uhc
he
just
claps
back
with
that
he
thinks
health
insurance
companies
have
no
choice
to
act
the
way
they
do
and
that
socialized
healthcare
will
only
make
things
worse
he
s
also
anti
union
not
because
he
s
rich
but
because
30
years
ago
when
he
worked
on
submarines
the
union
doing
the
same
thing
across
the
road
got
less
money
his
mindset
is
heavily
influenced
by
the
cold
war
era
the
media
is
working
overtime
to
turn
the
public
against
luigi
last
week
it
was
the
most
uniting
event
since
9
11
only
a
week
later
and
it
s
your
standard
50
50
blue
team
takes
one
side
red
team
takes
the
other
there
also
millions
of
freaks
who
dont
like
murder
there
s
a
fair
amount
of
normal
people
who
don
t
think
the
ceos
of
companies
they
don
t
like
should
be
shot
dead
on
the
street
i
don
t
suspect
seating
a
jury
will
be
that
hard
freaks
you
need
to
live
in
an
echo
chamber
to
think
that
he
ll
be
convicted
almost
certainly
your
average
person
still
has
integrity
you
don
t
have
to
like
health
care
ceos
to
convict
wanna
bet
he
will
be
convicted
by
a
jury
of
his
peers
there
is
no
excuse
for
killing
another
human
being
i
don
t
think
a
jury
will
have
sympathy
for
a
well
off
educated
kid
who
killed
soneone
purposely
if
you
stepped
out
of
your
echo
chamber
for
a
moment
you
d
know
that
the
vast
majority
of
americans
would
have
no
problem
convicting
a
cold
blooded
murderer
despite
the
unpopular
career
choice
of
their
victim
a
regular
jury
would
also
all
agree
that
water
s
were
night
time
s
dark
it
s
ok
for
normal
folk
on
jury
to
come
in
agreeing
on
obvious
truths
jury
of
millionaires
that
s
about
9
of
america
it
s
not
that
much
total
wealth
if
that
s
all
they
needed
it
wouldn
t
be
that
difficult
but
people
with
net
worth
of
a
million
still
struggle
with
healthcare
i
would
convict
him
in
a
heartbeat
i
think
fox
is
busy
reporting
on
trumps
bs
to
care
the
main
channels
arnt
even
reporting
on
this
they
are
focused
on
trump
only
its
mostly
the
local
ones
and
some
adjacent
ones
even
the
main
late
night
show
talking
hosts
are
focused
on
trump
only
i
do
suspect
they
are
getting
marching
orders
to
not
discuss
the
murder
from
above
network
president
they
dont
want
the
news
to
spread
that
far
especially
if
the
talk
show
host
starts
discussing
its
going
to
reach
even
more
people
lay
off
the
meth
and
explain
to
the
class
how
my
comment
says
anything
about
favorability
or
hatred
toward
trump
some
truly
strange
evaluations
are
made
i
m
reading
about
the
timothy
mcveigh
trial
okc
bombing
and
in
that
case
the
prosecutors
asked
jurors
if
they
were
x
files
fans
and
dismissed
the
ones
who
said
yes
lawyers
only
get
so
many
strikes
and
the
court
has
to
seat
a
jury
bias
people
end
up
on
juries
all
the
time
the
court
just
instructs
them
to
put
aside
that
bias
i
got
called
for
jury
duty
for
a
guy
with
child
porn
on
his
phone
the
judge
and
lawyers
were
under
no
illusion
they
were
getting
a
jury
with
no
opinion
on
child
pornography
i
recently
got
out
of
jury
duty
for
an
incident
that
happened
in
a
casino
cuz
fuck
gambling
have
you
ever
had
bad
run
ins
with
insurance
and
do
you
support
what
happened
no
okay
you
re
in
he
s
innocent
it
does
not
take
a
mastermind
to
do
this
well
most
people
haven
t
in
reality
the
majority
of
americans
actually
claim
to
like
their
insurance
because
they
haven
t
gotten
sick
enough
to
need
to
use
it
yet
it
will
be
incredibly
easy
to
find
a
dozen
people
who
haven
t
tbh
a
bunch
of
insufferable
redditors
think
they
ll
be
able
to
outsmart
experienced
lawyers
at
jury
selection
lots
of
weird
unrelated
questions
are
going
to
get
asked
i
got
out
of
jury
duty
for
a
crime
unrelated
to
drug
use
because
i
had
a
single
family
member
that
had
in
the
past
used
drugs
yeah
jury
selection
is
going
to
be
a
shit
show
when
most
of
the
population
has
experience
with
and
negative
feelings
towards
insurance
providers
i
was
dismissed
once
for
saying
doctors
are
only
human
and
sadly
humans
make
mistakes
they
did
in
the
assumption
of
getting
a
reward
money
which
they
arnt
getting
because
the
way
the
fbi
worded
the
reward
stipulations
and
regarding
no
one
would
turn
him
in
one
person
did
and
it
took
several
days
yeah
an
old
white
boomer
in
shithole
pa
no
surprise
there
you
won
t
see
any
old
white
boomers
on
this
jury
just
look
at
the
election
results
i
m
not
american
but
i
d
love
the
opportunity
to
complain
about
it
not
to
mention
poor
quality
of
doctors
in
a
lot
of
cases
just
takes
1
12
they
will
probably
choose
1
that
can
easily
convince
the
entire
group
to
vote
1
way
i
knew
someone
that
was
chosen
because
she
wouldnt
speak
out
against
annything
they
re
going
to
have
a
fuck
of
a
time

generally
a
lot
of
people
don
t
really
know
about
that
rule
but
a
lot
more
will
know
this
time
around
swear
i
ve
never
seen
it
discussed
this
often
before
oh
i
know
even
bringing
that
term
up
in
a
courtroom
will
get
you
thrown
in
jail
by
the
judge
most
times
yes
but
they
also
tend
to
have
a
just
world
fallacy
yes
but
many
are
on
medicare
and
they
still
have
a
traditional
mindset
he
wanted
to
get
caught
maybe
wouldn
t
it
depend
on
the
filament
used
how
long
you
had
to
microwave
it
for
i
know
some
are
very
easy
to
melt
but
i
thought
some
were
more
robust
he
is
also
one
human
being
who
murdered
someone
else
this
is
not
something
light
and
easy
regardless
of
who
it
s
being
done
to
and
was
wanted
by
the
whole
country
it
s
weird
but
real
possibility
he
just
wasn
t
thinking
straight
just
for
clarity
i
heard
the
story
that
the
employee
called
the
cops
came
and
asked
the
guy
for
id
and
he
handed
them
the
same
fake
id
he
used
for
the
hostel
you
are
right
it
doesn
t
make
sense
for
a
mcworker
to
ask
for
id
yeah
a
lot
of
stuff
isn
t
adding
up
yep
my
bet
is
a
facial
recognition
hit
and
then
they
pinged
his
phone
what
has
convinced
you
of
this
i
mean
whatever
it
s
2024
i
don
t
see
why
they
would
need
to
lie
about
successfully
being
able
to
find
someone
i
think
society
has
gotten
passed
the
point
of
people
being
able
to
care
about
something
like
that
in
horror
like
they
might
have
decades
ago
my
thoughts
also
as
of
recently
probably
some
absolutely
fucking
dystopian
electronic
surveillance
which
would
further
fuel
the
rage
which
is
justified
and
needs
way
more
fuel
imo
i
thought
the
story
was
that
the
mcdonald
employee
saw
that
he
was
suspicious
because
he
wore
a
mask
and
stuff
but
yeah
i
agree
things
aren
t
adding
up
and
it
just
seems
like
the
police
department
is
just
releasing
different
stories
to
muddle
with
our
attention
why
is
it
always
a
conspiracy
why
would
they
lie
about
them
receiving
the
payout
then
curious
it
seems
if
the
media
says
they
did
not
pay
up
we
will
be
more
outraged
lol
idk
how
true
it
is
but
i
saw
they
called
911
and
not
the
tip
line
and
calling
the
tip
line
is
a
requirement
for
the
reward
to
pay
out
so
decent
chance
they
don
t
get
it
if
any
of
that
is
true
actually
the
real
story
is
that
another
customer
recognized
the
guy
from
all
the
news
coverage
that
customer
alerted
an
employee
the
cops
came
and
asked
luigi
if
he
had
been
in
nyc
recently
that
question
made
luigi
start
to
physically
shake
he
s
a
scared
coward
he
was
detained
arrested
when
the
cops
found
his
illegal
gun
and
fraudulent
materials
stop
making
up
conspiracy
theories
to
fit
your
narrative
why
are
you
convinced
of
that
why
won
t
the
guy
see
the
reward
money
if
they
don
t
pay
him
why
wouldn
t
he
sue
for
it
thus
exposing
the
whole
conspiracy
the
informant
i
would
be
out
of
the
country
that
sucks
i
don
t
agree
with
her
actions
and
i
hope
she
stays
safe
someone
tried
to
pry
the
door
off
our
house
at
3
a
m
called
the
cops
immediately
cop
pulled
up
to
the
curb
and
didn
t
even
bother
getting
out
of
his
car
even
something
as
simple
as
asking
a
cop
for
directions
has
gone
poorly
my
old
neighbor
was
a
meth
head
in
a
finer
fit
of
methy
rage
he
tried
to
burn
my
house
down
but
i
didn
t
have
it
on
camera
so
the
cops
couldn
t
actually
do
anything
according
to
them
i
don
t
think
i
ve
ever
been
helped
by
the
cops
oh
but
i
have
been
threatened
by
the
cops
when
i
still
worked
in
ems
one
helped
my
wife
change
a
tire
when
she
was
on
the
side
of
a
road
with
our
baby
in
the
back
seat
and
they
caught
the
guys
who
robbed
the
house
across
the
street
from
me
several
years
back
save
thousands
on
lawyer
fees
dealing
with
squatters
by
using
this
one
weird
trick
well
yes
lol
i
meant
he
was
in
a
prison
outside
of
the
country
where
he
is
a
citizen
yup
and
it
s
still
delicious

him
well
i

i
ll
keep

on

then
yeah
i
m
sure
the
judge
in
this
case
isn
t
going
to
have
any
of
that
removed
by
reddit
shut
up
it
has
everything
to
do
with
why
i
feel
how
i
feel
you
pile
of
sticks
huh
the
winning
side
was
calling
in
bomb
threats
to
polling
locations
on
election
day
and
was
calling
in
threats
daily
in
springfield
based
on
a
lie
that
local
haitians
were
eating
dogs
and
cats
for
the
month
prior
you
don
t
realize
yet
that
this
is
what
winning
looks
like
if
the
police
are
working
to
keep
the
shitty
government
that
doesn
t
serve
the
people
then
they
are
part
of
the
problem
listen
i
get
it
they
re
just
doing
their
jobs
the
ceo
was
just
doing
his
job
the
news
is
just
doing
their
jobs
the
guards
at
the
concentration
camps
were
just
doing
their
jobs
no
one
is
at
fault
except
evil
happens
and
at
some
point
people
need
to
decide
they
don
t
want
to
be
a
part
of
it
yes
i
m
just
booing
from
the
sidelines
on
reddit
and
not
going
to
go
start
a
revolt
myself
but
it
is
for
sure
that
nothing
will
change
if
you
don
t
make
yourself
heard
that
shit
is
still
a
half
measure
that
working
insured
people
have
the
choice
to
go
bankrupt
or
die
when
they
get
sick
in
this
country
is
a
sin
on
the
level
of
slavery
the
3
5ths
compromise
didn
t
solve
that
problem
either
that
s
a
bandaid
where
a
tourniquet
is
required
i
don
t
remember
all
of
it
american
public
schools
for
the
win
not
all
of
them
we
couldn
t
send
phillip
morris
execs
to
jail
we
ll
never
see
insurance
execs
take
responsibility
for
the
damage
they
ve
done
to
american
health
the
government
is
essentially
in
their
pocket
and
thanks
to
leolib
policy
these
people
are
held
to
absolutely
no
standards
regardless
of
luigis
alleged
actions
its
a
response
to
the
shit
material
conditions
we
suffer
under
exactly
people
are
acting
like
it
was
this
one
guy
sitting
at
his
desk
going
through
patient
files
saying
denied
denied
denied
as
if
he
ever
once
looked
at
an
actual
file
or
claim
even
if
you
re
talking
about
the
policies
that
are
set
who
really
thinks
he
s
doing
that
all
on
his
own
he
was
running
a
business
a
business
that
is
necessitated
by
the
healthcare
situation
in
this
country
if
this
company
approved
every
claim
and
went
out
of
business
because
of
it
another
company
would
step
right
in
and
do
what
this
company
is
doing
right
now
nothing
is
going
to
change
the
government
would
have
to
change
the
system
for
any
real
difference
to
be
made
and
how
will
this
motivate
them
to
do
that
it
s
an
expression
of
discontent
in
any
case
just
look
at
the
overwhelming
support
people
are
sick
of
this
shit
and
asking
nicely
and
pushing
for
better
policy
has
never
worked
removed
i
fully
agree
and
this
seems
to
be
the
take
of
everyone
not
on
reddit
i
talk
to
it
s
just
on
reddit
where
people
are
suddenly
okay
with
cold
blooded
murder
of
americans
who
haven
t
even
been
accused
of
a
crime
i
ll
blame
it
on
a
mix
of
anonymity
and
autistic
20
year
olds
here
i
have
a
much
more
cynical
view
of
modern
american
politics
most
of
those
great
accomplishments
are
fading
in
the
rear
view
and
all
signs
are
pointing
to
a
much
less
equitable
future
for
our
democracy
s
participants
the
ruling
class
here
has
soured
the
housing
market
outsourced
jobs
created
one
of
the
most
cruel
healthcare
systems
imaginable
bought
up
and
flattened
our
media
environment
rigged
the
political
system
and
gathered
every
penny
they
could
while
pushing
more
and
more
people
over
the
edge
into
misery
and
poverty
legislation
that
s
touted
as
our
new
deal
is
largely
composed
of
corporate
hand
outs
to
companies
that
don
t
need
any
help
we
re
given
milk
toast
candidates
to
vote
for
who
never
accomplish
anything
meaningful
the
game
is
rigged
it
s
gone
too
far
and
people
are
snapping
i
m
just
happy
it
was
some
shithead
ceo
this
time
instead
of
a
school
or
concert
well
then
hopefully
he
will
be
proven
innocent
either
before
or
during
trial
who
do
you
call
then
you
posted
the
same
variation
of
what
you
re
trying
to
say
twice
for
some
reason
i
don
t
appreciate
being
called
a
child
but
fair
enough
yes
while
my
sister
was
being
beaten
to
death
by
her
husband
the
cops
were
called
and
they
stopped
it
and
she
lived
the
police
were
not
standing
on
the
porch
she
called
911
and
locked
herself
in
the
attic
i
was
not
there
nor
my
brother
nor
my
father
we
live
about
an
hour
away
of
course
they
re
not
there
in
seconds
because
that
isn
t
practical
but
police
do
save
people
at
times
she
would
have
died
and
nearly
did
there
were
no
neighbors
helping
or
anyone
else
kyle
rittenhouse
shot
people
who
were
directly
threatening
his
life
just
say
you
don
t
understand
how
self
defense
works
and
we
can
move
on
yeah
he
s
getting
convicted
i
m
just
happy
they
didn
t
assassinate
him
during
the
arrest
they
killed
michael
reinoehl
before
he
could
get
a
trial
and
evidence
supported
his
claim
to
self
defence
do
you
still
have
two
kidneys
congratulations
you
win
23
98
please
pay
me
i
don
t
expect
a
public
trial
they
won
t
give
him
exposure
and
time
for
his
ideas
and
manifesto
either
psychiatric
ward
or
epsteined
you
mean
they
are
claiming
we
are
the
only
ones
just
like
they
claim

shooter
is
a
democrat

i
clicked
on
related
to
him
the
top
comment
was
without
condoning
or
condemning
i
understand
you
re
making
shit
up
bro
i
have
a
decent
sized
group
of
rightwing
friends
and
we
were
all
sad
this
guy
got
caught
lol
bruh
i
know
lots
of
conservatives
and
they
re
as
stoked
about
mangione
did
as
anyone
on
the
left
this
is
where
left
and
right
unites
we
ve
all
been
screwed
over
by
health
insurance
companies
went
and
checked
and
immediately
saw
them
supporting
him
you
re
full
of
it
both
sides
are
united
on
this
the
red
hats
are
complete
idiots
seriously
they
will
root
against
and
vote
against
things
that
are
clearly
beneficial
for
them
or
are
an
effort
to
fight
for
them
fucking
idiotic
sheep
so
do
they
not
know
that
they
voted
for
a
rapist
criminal
and
celebrated
it
they
are
so
funny
they
love
to
cosplay
with
their
guns
and
to
act
all
macho
and
dont
tread
on
me
and
small
government
but
they
really
are
scaredy
cats
that
just
want
to
kiss
the
boot
i
just
went
to
your
link
you
are
wrong
i
couldn
t
see
a
bad
comment
against
mangione
i
like
my
criminals
to
have
5
felonies
not
34
top
comments
on
the
first
thread
i
saw
are
fuck
that
ceo
american
people
have
had
enough
health
insurance
an
unnecessary
middleman
and
murder
bad
but
i
understand
they
even
have
flaired
only
comments
turned
on
i
ve
got
hope
this
unites
us
or
at
least
bridges
the
gap
a
bit
and
focuses
the
lower
class
in
the
right
direction
they
re
saying
that
pelosi
hired
him
i
peeked
in
there
the
other
day
and
there
was
zero
love
for
the
healthcare
industry
i
just
looked
at
one
of
the
conservative
sub
post
they
re
all
talking
about
how
fuck
the
health
system
is
lol
no
one
was
hating
this
guy
the
right
cheered
on
rittenhouse
i
m
over
that
bs
but
j6
traitors
are
ok
i
went
and
checked
top
comment
was
we
deserve
better
than
the
scam
health
insurance
gives
us
and
without
condoning
i
understand
i
would
say
your
wrong
but
luigi
is
only
an
accused
criminal
their
guy
is
a
convicted
criminal
yet
they
masturbate
furiously
to
pictures
of
kyle
rittenhouse
murdering
actual
innocent
people
without
hypocrisy
conservatives
wouldn
t
have
any
values
at
all
almost
everyone
lives
in
a
bubble
amirite
if
only
the
left
could
understand
the
right
s
motivations
without
demonizing
them
we
could
come
together
to
defeat
that
garbage
but
we
see
what
happened
with
the
election
that
ain
t
happening
anytime
soon
the
right
idolizes
rich
people
because
they
think
there
s
a
chance
they
ll
be
that
someday
there
are
deeper
psychological
reasons
than
that
but
that
s
the
basic
idea
of
course
they
hate
this
beefcake
check
out
johnathan
haidt
s
the
righteous
mind
to
start
learning
you
can
find
him
on
youtube
explaining
it
pretty
well
without
actually
reading
the
book
here
s
the
entrance
to
the
rabbit
hole
https
youtu
be
onum4akzlge
si
nv2tir7virb2rzhy
with
jury
nullification
jurors
can
opt
to
not
convict
even
if
they
believe
the
accused
is
guilty
based
on
morality
justice
or
societal
reasons
this
obviously
isn
t
a
certainty
but
could
happen
but
brian
wasn
t
he
actively
participated
in
killing
people
for
profit
and
that
can
be
a
fatal
choice
yeah
actually
their
comment
is
kind
of
shocking
because
it
implies
that
a
juror
would
need
to
think
health
insurance
ceo
good
to
vote
guilty
on
a
clear
as
day
murder
case
lol
what
the
fuck
bro
yeah
just
saying
but
if
hate
that
ceo
i
feel
nothing
at
his
passing
if
i
was
on
the
jury
assuming
both
sides
argued
competently
id
likely
rule
guilty
for
some
level
of
homicide
his
killing
wasn
t
unlawful
luigi
ended
a
mass
murderer
given
the
land
of
bootlickers
we
live
in
that
just
voted
for
trump
i
wouldn
t
be
surprised
i
mean
some
jackass
class
traitor
called
him
in
so
the
guy
s
politics
were
completely
all
over
the
place
there
s
already
rumors
that
he
s
bisexual
and
the
gays
are
already
in
love
with
him
because
he
commented
on
his
pretty
big
dick
in
a
tweet
doubtful
those
jurys
usually
get
removed
asap
if
they
showed
bias
like
that
they
are
looking
for
the
retired
and
try
find
people
that
hasnt
seen
the
news
yet
you
only
need
one
you
re
right
millions
who
hate
it
when
insurance
companies
murder
their
customers
on
a
massive
scale
it
s
just
different
cause
you
dont
have
to
look
at
it
and
it
feels
normal
cause
we
re
so
fucked
up
i
d
love
it
if
no
one
ever
died
i
don
t
even
like
the
death
penalty
lmao
by
normal
people
you
must
be
class
traitors
boot
lickers
luckily
nobody
i
know
friend
or
family
is
like
that
shit
i
saw
suburban
moms
in
my
neighborhood
calling
for
someone
to
get
more
of
these
ceos
honestly
love
to
see
it
finally
most
of
us
clearly
not
ring
kissers
like
you
are
unifying
behind
something
but
you
shouldn
t
like
health
care
ceos
and
you
shouldn
t
convict
this
hero
if
a
jury
follows
the
rule
of
the
law
strictly
he
might
there
is
no
legal
precedent
for
he
killed
the
guy
but
the
guy
really
had
it
coming
you
re
right
hollywood
never
makes
movies
about
vigilante
justice
it
s
super
unpopular
if
you
stepped
out
of
your
echo
chamber
you
d
know
most
people
hate
the
american
healthcare
system
because
they
re
evil
pieces
of
shit
who
profit
when
they
deny
health
care
coverage
to
sick
and
dying
patients
you
re
just
delusional
hard
to
not
assume
since
it
seems
most
people
are
so
far
left
and
reddit
is
littered
with
anti
trumpers
my
bad
perhaps
they
were
thought
to
be
prone
to
believing
conspiracy
theories
that
s
my
best
guess
that
you
don
t
care
about
but
i
found
your
anecdote
interesting
that
s
due
to
statistical
correlation
between
groups
no
lawyers
get
a
limited
number
of
preemptory
strikes
but
challenges
for
cause
are
unlimited
so
if
80
potential
jurors
say
they
won
t
convict
no
matter
what
they
all
get
struck
i
got
called
in
as
a
potential
juror
two
months
ago
and
it
was
incredible
they
chose
one
guy
who
obviously
had
a
very
poor
grasp
on
the
english
language
also
almost
everyone
of
the
30
jurors
in
the
first
group
to
be
questioned
came
from
the
same
area
of
the
city
i
was
far
away
from
them
in
terms
of
location
also
i
was
probably
one
of
only
two
white
people
the
jury
selection
process
isn
t
that
simple
or
easy
to
manipulate
they
will
grill
you
the
questions
are
intentionally
antagonistic
on
both
sides
they
will
also
delve
into
your
social
media
and
internet
history
hire
a
firm
to
do
a
thorough
background
check
analyze
your
demeanor
and
body
language
they
will
find
stuff
you
thought
you
had
deleted
it
isn
t
an
honor
system
especially
not
for
a
high
profile
case
like
this
i
think
most
people
would
agree
that
it
s
an
absolutely
blessed
life
who
can
t
name
a
family
member
co
worker
friend
or
acquaintance
victimized
by
the
insurance
industry
at
their
most
vulnerable
people
aren
t
beep
boop
rationality
machines
and
when
something
hurts
the
ones
we
love
we
remember
the
whole
ceo
thing
plays
a
factor
as
well
forget
healthcare
for
a
moment
many
people
hate
the
wealthy
the
basic
math
behind
health
insurance
is
you
have
more
healthy
people
who
are
paying
who
never
gets
sick
or
need
constantly
use
that
service
than
there
are
unhealthy
people
who
are
objectively
a
net
drain
on
the
insurance
that
is
why
health
insurance
companies
before
the
aca
were
so
adamant
on
not
letting
people
get
a
plan
if
they
had
existing
preconditions
because
they
can
not
profit
off
of
people
who
are
chronically
sick
it
shouldn
t
be
shocking
that
there
are
tens
of
millions
of
americans
who
do
not
need
to
regularly
see
the
doctor
get
surgery
or
need
specialized
treatment
their
entire
lives
and
many
more
who
only
will
need
it
once
or
twice
their
whole
life
no
some
of
us
have
useful
insurance
mine
is
excellent
i
still
want
uhc
because
i
think
everyone
should
have
access
to
excellent
coverage
not
just
me
but
i
don
t
feel
like
i
need
to
lie
about
mine
being
crappy
difficult
we
re
still
talking
about
health
insurance
right
at
least
people
have
had
their
time
stolen
for
the
sake
of
profit
what
s
europe
like
this
time
of
year
perhaps
the
best
example
dont
even
get
me
started
and
then
there
would
be
a
retrial
no
you
d
need
all
12
to
acquit
1
out
of
12
would
be
a
mistrial
and
they
would
undoubtedly
try
again
or
plead
trying
to
convince
people
of
the
jury
to
vote
one
way
in
ways
not
related
to
the
evidence
presented
or
the
law
is
a
good
way
to
at
the
minimum
get
booted
from
the
jury
all
12
would
have
to
make
that
decisions
themselves
without
speaking
of
it
yeah
but
i
highly
doubt
it
the
reddit
echo
chamber
is
just
not
that
indicative
of
the
real
world
reddit
would
have
underground
railroad
smuggled
this
dude
to
timbuktu
however
in
the
real
world
all
it
took
was
some
maga
boomer
to
call
911
at
a
bumfuck
mcdonalds
and
manhunt
over
the
chances
of
getting
that
person
on
a
jury
are
far
far
higher
than
getting
12
people
to
vote
against
the
facts
a
hung
jury
results
in
a
mistrial
and
the
prosecution
gets
another
chance
to
meet
their
burden
what
i
googled
and
not
seeing
anything
can
you
provide
your
source
even
heat
resistant
filaments
won
t
last
long
in
a
microwave
doesnt
matter
if
you
set
the
microwave
long
enough
it
will
melt
it
easily
just
set
it
to
60
minutes
it
will
be
easier
with
water
doesn
t
make
sense
for
someone
on
the
lam
to
give
police
the
fake
id
that
was
known
info
in
the
ongoing
manhunt
that
seems
like
a
huge
misstep
by
the
police
to
just
walk
into
a
mcdonald
s
and
id
a
person
for
no
apparent
reason
oh
for
fucks
sakes
you
think
they
have
facial
recognition
tech
that
scans
every
human
being
in
altoona
nope
can
t
you
just
read
and
listen
to
the
numerous
news
stories
on
what
went
down
that
way
you
wouldn
t
need
to
put
out
guesses
and
your
own
conspiracy
theories
nobody
has
received
any
money
yet
these
payouts
don
t
happen
until
there
is
a
firm
conviction
and
even
then
they
put
it
on
the
onus
of
the
tipster
to
call
in
after
said
conviction
to
request
their
payment
before
which
it
will
need
to
be
reviewed
by
a
board
or
official
to
determine
if
they
truly
qualify
this
sounds
fake
can
you
sure
where
you
read
it
were
you
there
why
do
you
have
this
weird
hostility
against
the
health
care
hero
bravery
is
being
scared
and
doing
it
anyway
sue
for
what
there
s
no
promise
of
money
minimum
wage
worker
isn
t
going
to
be
able
to
afford
a
lawyer
to
sue
the
system
i
was
just
being
difficult
i
m
up
past
my
bedtime
i
agree
but
to
totally
ignore
how
this
is
viewed
societally
is
insulting
i
expected
more
from
both
of
them
politicians
can
denounce
violence
while
also
acknowledging
that
the
public
has
had
it
with
the
corporate
elite
then
again
there
is
no
nuance
in
america
all
zero
tolerance
only
black
and
white
lots
of
labels
and
unfortunately
he
s
a
schmuck
who
is
afraid
of
what
do
you
think
there
is
an
army
of
kazynski
supporters
out
there
who
are
about
to
start
assassinating
insurance
ceo
s
cringy
is
subjective
all
ceos
naw
costco
s
and
arizona
iced
tea
s
are
safe
yep
i
m
an
fbi
agent
you
got
me
dude
he
s
from
a
rich
family
he
was
born
rich
luigi
isn
t
one
of
us
pick
a
different
hero
that
doesn
t
murder
people
this
issue
isn
t
solely
that
people
are
rich
it
s
their
actions
and
policies
they
support
through
ridiculous
amounts
of
political
influence
if
he
was
uneducated
from
a
poor
family
he
would
be
dismissed
easier
this
is
politics
credibility
matters
sometimes
you
have
to
be
strategic
if
someone
signed
their
name
to
a
document
authorizing
your
murder
would
you
consider
it
less
bad
than
pulling
the
trigger
themselves
regular
people
don
t
have
the
means
to
obfuscate
their
terrible
actions
like
that
rich
people
and
corporations
do
that
every
day
then
they
have
people
like
you
to
defend
them
if
you
want
things
to
get
better
the
rich
need
to
either
use
their
influence
to
implement
better
policies
or
that
influence
needs
to
be
reduced
to
that
of
normal
people
what
s
happening
is
a
natural
consequence
of
a
highly
screwed
up
system
where
normal
people
feel
powerless
you
can
even
throw
the
election
of
trump
in
there
too
looks
like
you
get
that
feeling
of
agency
by
choosing
to
side
with
the
powerful
hoping
for
a
little
trickle
down
different
strokes
for
different
folks
if
a
rich
guy
saw
how
fucked
things
were
and
acted
it
only
proves
his
point
nah
he
s
one
of
us
you
aren
t
tho
that
s
for
sure
definitely
not
my
hero
i
never
said
that
i
think
this
is
all
interesting
for
sure
though
i
understand
what
you
re
saying
but
i
think
you
re
giving
nypd
a
lot
more
credit
than
they
really
deserve
nypd
opened
a
tip
line
the
tip
line
was
then
flooded
with
tips
a
large
portion
of
them
said
the
shooter
was
at
the
north
pole
i
don
t
need
to
tell
you
those
tips
don
t
need
to
be
investigated
with
the
information
we
know
with
the
camera
footage
and
stuff
do
you
think
nypd
got
that
stuff
or
do
you
think
it
was
released
on
the
internet
and
the
police
found
it
that
way
all
i
m
really
trying
to
say
here
is
that
police
nypd
or
papd
didn
t
really
do
much
here
a
class
traitor
and
a
racist
too
i
bet
you
re
on
santa
s
really
nice
list
why
are
yo
uso
hostile
you
realize
you
replied
to
me
right
i
responded
to
you
in
ernest
and
wasn
t
disrespectful
or
anything
towards
you
not
really
sure
why
you
re
coming
at
me
with
this
energy
well
that
homophobia
goes
right
along
with
your
other
bad
takes
i
don
t
trust
masked
heroes
like
you
then
perhaps
you
shouldn
t
speak
on
topics
you
have
no
knowledge
of
is
your
solution
to
murder
them
and
how
will
this
motivate
them
to
do
that
one
of
the
same
forces
that
they
use
on
us
fear
of
the
consequences
what
do
you
think
a
protest
is
meant
to
represent
it
s
an
implied
threat
that
the
situation
will
escalate
if
demands
are
not
met
and
the
protesters
have
the
numbers
to
win
through
violence
if
it
got
to
that
point
no
one
is
pretending
that
there
are
just
a
few
evil
people
or
whatever
this
shows
leaders
that
they
will
be
held
accountable
for
their
actions
outside
of
a
legal
political
system
that
they
have
significant
influence
in
the
fact
that
this
guy
was
shot
and
many
people
aren
t
too
upset
shows
that
the
legal
political
system
is
failing
you
can
say
no
you
shouldn
t
do
that
but
it
will
get
worse
until
actual
changes
are
made
blame
the
people
who
have
significant
influence
over
our
political
system
they
are
the
reason
our
policy
options
seem
so
limited
it
s
like
how
the
affordable
care
act
had
a
public
option
that
was
removed
maybe
if
the
lobbyists
didn
t
get
that
provision
removed
the
guy
would
still
be
alive
why
not
blame
them
why
do
you
choose
to
focus
criticism
and
blame
the
least
powerful
people
do
you
have
the
slightest
idea
of
how
much
influence
rich
people
have
in
politics
at
every
level
for
the
next
four
years
we
ll
be
fully
ruled
by
billionaires
do
you
think
there
will
be
positive
incremental
change
on
this
front
during
that
time
if
billionaires
could
adequately
balance
their
self
interest
with
the
well
being
of
society
we
would
not
be
where
we
are
some
mechanism
has
to
even
the
power
level
of
people
in
a
democratic
society
at
one
time
that
was
the
legislature
and
judiciary
now
we
have
protest
and
violence
bring
the
former
back
and
there
will
be
less
of
the
latter
billionaires
could
make
this
happen
right
now
but
they
choose
not
to
the
guy
was
already
replaced
changes
nothing
real
change
does
not
start
this
way
we
need
another
bernie
sanders
it
s
going
to
get
much
worse
the
next
4
years
as
well
nope
he
s
a
scum
bag
but
he
s
taking
advantage
of
our
late
stage
capitalism
there
is
no
ruling
class
every
person
in
power
is
there
because
the
american
people
decided
it
in
some
way
or
another
vote
if
you
complain
that
your
vote
doesn
t
matter
well
that
just
means
society
doesn
t
agree
with
you
it
s
an
important
argument
if
i
understand
it
correctly
yes
we
had
gains
in
equality
in
the
past
the
rearview
mirror
as
you
call
it
but
the
current
distribution
of
power
has
both
eroded
those
gains
and
prevented
further
progress
thus
frustration
boils
over
this
reminds
me
of
the
political
scientist
jacob
hacker
s
book
the
great
risk
shift
the
new
economic
insecurity
and
the
decline
of
the
american
dream
he
writes
that
more
and
more
economic
risk
is
shifting
from
government
and
business
onto
the
fragile
shoulders
of
the
american
family
of
course
there
are
things
government
has
done
medical
insurance
coverage
is
at
record
levels
though
quality
obviously
varies
thanks
to
the
aca
we
passed
an
infrastructure
bill
bipartisan
though
largely
by
democrats
and
federal
investments
spurred
a
coronavirus
vaccine
that
is
highly
effective
due
to
reliance
on
messenger
rna
which
we
invested
in
understanding
we
may
disagree
over
whether
the
glass
is
half
empty
or
half
full
but
the
question
is
how
to
make
further
progress
depends
on
the
emergency
happening
but
some
combination
of
fire
department
ems
social
services
my
friends
there
s
no
one
to
call
the
specific
times
i
can
think
to
call
the
cops
is
after
being
robbed
when
i
had
to
file
a
police
report
so
insurance
would
pay
up
there
s
still
time
the
defense
will
make
this
100
about
health
insurance
and
the
suffering
they
cause
and
i
guarantee
you
can
find
one
person
out
of
12
who
will
absolutely
agree
that
this
is
on
that
not
him
jury
nullification
should
be
discussed
more

if

they

s
they

mean
nothing
that
s
why
they
re

not
anymore
the
talking
heads
have
given
them
their
marching
orders
and
the
sheep
are
falling
in
line
behind
law
and
order
and
only
liberals
would
cheer
for
this
remember
a
key
tenet
of
conservative
idealogy
is
that
rich
people
are
rich
because
they
deserve
it
and
because
jesus
loves
them
more
health
insurance
has
indiscriminately
harmed
people
they
dont
care
about
culture
war
bs
thats
why
theres
universal
support
against
insurance
and
thats
why
the
rich
right
wing
grifters
is
getting
flak
for
blaming
it
on
the
left
yup
and
i
saw
a
comment
saying
how
law
and
order
are
core
conservative
beliefs
so
is
that
why
they
voted
a
convicted
felon
yeah
and
their
flair
said
liberal
i
saw
several
comments
how
right
wingers
were
screwed
by
the
uhc
denying
thier
claims
and
harming
them
in
the
process
hard
to
feel
sympathy
for
the
ceo
over
that
don
t
believe
that
dudes
lies
the
right
is
a
fan
of
him
too
go
look
for
yourself
they
know
they
don
t
care
and
the
reason
they
don
t
care
is
because
in
their
mind
the
rules
are
different
some
people
i
e
them
and
trump
are
just
better
chosen
by
god
and
divine
providence
so
if
you
or
your
guy
get
caught
in
the
exact
same
situation
as
someone
from
their
side
but
get
differing
treatment
that
s
just
the
system
working
as
it
s
supposed
to
the
only
consistency
you
can
expect
from
them
comes
down
to
us
vs
them
are
you
claiming
people
trying
to
attack
kyle
rittenhouse
were
more
innocent
than
a
man
walking
out
of
his
hotel
that
s
not
how
that
works
the
jury
can
simply
vote
not
guilty
and
that
s
that
a
judge
can
t
do
anything
it
really
couldn
t
happen
there
is
zero
chance
that
somehow
an
entire
jury
agrees
to
nullify
here
a
hung
jury
is
a
strong
possibility
though
deleted
jury
nullification
isn
t
the
escape
route
you
think
it
is
the
vast
majority
of
potential
jurors
are
not
17
years
old
and
on
tiktok
it
wasn
t
murder
it
was
justice
you
think
you
have
to
be
a
class
traitor
to
vote
to
convict
someone
who
executed
someone
in
broad
daylight
on
a
busy
street
class
traitor
this
kid
is
a
rich
guy
you
fucking
clown
he
s
not
from
the
working
class
he
doesn
t
care
about
the
working
class
he
s
related
to
politicians
and
is
from
a
big
rich
family
in
maryland
i
d
convict
this
pos
in
a
heartbeat
he
wasn
t
some
vigilante
or
something
99
of
the
time
these
shooters
are
just
insane
people
who
think
that
the
easter
bunny
ordered
them
to
do
it
his
family
is
literally
richer
than
the
ceo
s
sympathizing
with
the
shooter
and
unwilling
unable
to
execute
the
law
are
two
different
things
people
can
be
more
than
one
thing
not
terribly
uncommon
when
my
conservative
family
complains
about
work
and
what
d
they
d
like
to
do
they
damn
near
sound
like
wobblies
i
doubt
they
know
what
the
iww
is
but
any
mention
of
trade
unions
anarchism
and
socialism
and
they
ll
start
frothing
at
the
mouth
their
politics
are
a
mish
mash
of
working
class
class
politics
and
conservative
culture
war
bullshit
that
s
what
happens
when
your
politics
are
mainly
in
reaction
to
changes
in
your
personal
conditions
i
thought
he
s
gay
the
retired
would
statistically
fit
that
category
they
approved
mcarthyism
after
all
and
the
sexond
point
is
only
if
both
sides
are
looking
for
a
fair
jury
sounds
like
you
re
lost
to
the
maga
and
not
surrounded
by
normal
people
also
class
traitor
isn
t
a
thing
and
green
hat
wasn
t
motivated
by
anything
other
than
rfk
s
beliefs
on
american
medicine
except
that
s
the
same
mentality
when
the
small
town
white
bigot
jury
knowingly
convicts
a
minority
defendant
vigilantism
is
vigilantism
and
it
s
a
bit
rich
acting
like
half
this
country
just
voting
for
the
candidates
and
party
that
go
out
of
their
way
to
enable
and
protect
ceos
like
this
one
are
totally
on
board
with
seeing
this
guy
as
a
hero
let
alone
freeing
him
they
ll
get
their
talking
marching
orders
from
trump
and
friends
and
will
be
demanding
his
blood
by
the
time
the
jury
selection
starts
they
never
do
because
it
paints
the
actual
perpetrators
a
bad
light
aka
rich
people
etc
i
doubt
they
would
make
villians
that
think
they
re
doing
the
right
thing
either
people
hate
that
you
really
should
stop
smoking
meth
even
right
wingers
are
agreeing
with
luigi
that
was
part
of
it
there
was
also
a
specific
popular
episode
of
the
show
with
an
anti
death
penalty
message
hey
x
files
fan
here
who
thinks
conspiracy
theories
suck
i
think
xf
is
far
too
liberal
for
those
loonies
nobody
is
asking
questions
of
jurors
in
voir
dire
that
would
elicit
that
response
have
you
ever
been
called
for
jury
duty
did
they
give
you
a
pulpit
to
say
whatever
you
want
if
i
were
to
get
called
for
a
jury
anytime
soon
i
would
do
everything
in
my
power
to
lie
and
feign
non
bias
so
i
can
get
on
that
jury
and
vote
not
guilty
i
m
sure
i
m
not
unique
in
feeling
this
way
correct
the
da
will
not
select
a
biased
jury
he
will
be
convicted
on
the
facts
the
jury
does
not
decide
on
sentencing
they
usually
strike
people
with
a
language
barrier
i
know
people
who
went
through
it
before
who
said
they
didn
t
trust
cops
and
tried
to
get
out
of
it
and
they
still
got
picked
they
didn
t
think
it
was
that
rigorous
i
also
know
people
who
didn
t
post
anything
about
this
but
definitely
support
the
guy
it
happens
all
the
time
when
there
are
biased
jurors
even
if
they
are
trying
their
best
the
problem
is
all
of
that
unspent
money
doesn
t
go
into
the
pool
to
pay
for
treatment
of
sick
members
rather
it
goes
into
the
pockets
of
ceos
and
shareholders
who
have
no
vested
interest
in
the
wellbeing
of
the
policyholders
insurance
annoys
practically
100
of
the
population
there
s
been
times
in
almost
everyone
s
life
where
you
thought
your
deductible
was
a
bit
too
high
you
hoped
something
would
be
covered
and
it
isn
t
etc
but
the
number
of
people
who
would
actually
be
meaningfully
biased
against
thompson
is
much
lower
than
many
here
would
seem
to
believe
in
any
poll
you
look
at
a
majority
of
americans
are
satisfied
with
their
coverage
this
is
not
to
say
there
aren
t
plenty
of
people
who
are
not
because
obviously
there
are
but
i
don
t
think
it
s
accurate
to
think
that
america
at
large
is
ready
to
revolve
against
the
healthcare
system
i
haven
t
had
bad
run
ins
with
insurance
but
i
also
don
t
have
health
problems
sorry
to
burst
your
little
bubble
but
there
s
plenty
of
americans
who
never
had
a
medical
emergency
that
was
denied
by
their
insurance
or
even
had
a
medical
emergency
at
all
i
live
in
pittsburgh
i
wouldn
t
know
probably
depends
what
part
of
europe
you
re
talking
about
why
i
think
if
they
keep
retrialing
he
might
end
up
going
free
eventually
i
suspect
they
will
try
to
pull
a
fast
way
and
force
a
plea
deal
to
him
to
avoid
a
trial
which
undoubtly
will
acquit
him
the
wealthy
people
demand
justice
because
one
of
thier
own
get
killed
and
they
want
to
be
the
next
target
since
they
also
responsible
for
misery
in
the
usa
it
happens
all
the
time
i
don
t
know
guys
with
this
given
evidence
i
don
t
feel
good
about
voting
guilty
for
the
particular
alleged
crime
even
if
the
defendant
probably
actually
did
do
x
and
then
the
judge
prosecution
comes
back
with
a
lesser
crime
that
the
jury
agrees
that
the
evidence
is
substantial
for
for
example
big
time
drug
dealers
getting
possession
charges
because
the
evidence
of
distribution
isn
t
very
concrete
to
the
jury
who
also
might
have
scales
and
plastic

in

legal

https

basically
if
someone
is
guilty
of
breaking
the
law
but
the
jury
doesn
t
agree
with
the
law
so
they
make
them
not
guilty
that
s
a
really
dumbed
down
version
lawyers
don
t
come
at
me
yeah
he
honestly
would
ve
been
better
off
handing
them
his
real
id
no
one
knew
who
the
shooters
actual
name
and
identity
was
leading
up
to
that
point
and
if
he
was
caught
they
d
get
his
actual
identification
anyways
a
lot
of
this
doesn
t
make
sense
the
person
who
was
arrested
is
clearly
intelligent
the
person
who
shot
the
ceo
clearly
planned
things
pretty
well
assuming
they
re
the
same
person
why
didn
t
he
shred
that
id
why
didn
t
he
dispose
of
the
gun
that
s
not
a
misstep
at
all
they
can
ask
anyone
for
id
at
any
time
a
person
can
refuse
to
give
it
without
penalty
assuming
no
probable
cause
but
they
can
always
ask
no
apparent
reason
are
you
kidding
he
was
being
shown
on
national
news
repeatedly
constantly
a
60
000
reward
amount
was
offered
for
information
leading
to
his
arrest
a
customer
spotted
him
recognized
him
and
reported
it
he
was
being
sought
of
course
they
asked
him
for
id
they
also
asked
him
if
he
had
been
in
ny
recently
the
public
has
identified
many
perpetrators
of
major
crimes
in
this
way
it
may
also
be
true
that
luigi
was
not
aware
that
the
police
knew
about
the
fake
id
he
thought
he
could
get
away
with
it
he
obviously
thought
this
he
was
eating
in
a
public
restaurant
he
didn
t
kill
himself
as
many
do
the
news
that
doesn
t
even
provide
the
full
contents
of
his
note
even
though
journalists
were
provided
that
information
the
news
who
also
has
to
take
the
word
of
law
enforcement
i
simply
take
everything
with
a
large
grain
of
salt
media
lies
way
too
much
and
making
up
your
own
theories
isn
t
helpful
either
news
stories
on
what
went
down
the
news
never
lies
or
embellishes
anything
she
read
it
on
facebook
so
it
s
obviously
true
also
that
part
about
the
shaking
and
the
picture
where
he
peed
himself
clearly
that
confirms
it
case
closed
i
m
not
of
fb
so
shut
up
were
you
there
that
is
so
fucking
weird
i
have
no
hostility
towards
luigi
it
will
not
be
surprising
for
luigi
to
be
diagnosed
as
mentally
ill
it
will
not
be
surprising
if
he
pleads
diminished
capacity
it
will
not
be
surprising
if
he
s
a
drug
user
and
that
s
used
as
reason
for
reduced
sentencing
it
will
not
be
surprising
if
he
accepts
a
plea
agreement
to
forego
staying
in
prison
until
he
s
a
senior
citizen
his
mother
reported
him
as
a
missing
person
on
november
18th
he
has
not
been
in
touch
with
family
or
friends
for
6
months
he
is
no
hero
heroes
don
t
shoot
people
in
the
back
and
idolize
the
unabomber
those
are
not
heroic
actions
and
people
who
believe
in
democracy
don
t
believe
that
vigilante
justice
should
be
celebrated
bad
people
people
without
compassion
for
others
people
driven
by
greed
people
who
abuse
others
get
killed
by
both
bad
and
good
people
does
that
mean
they
re
not
held
accountable
for
the
crime
they
committed
because
the
person
they
killed
is
bad
and
what
is
the
criteria
to
define
someone
as
bad
and
what
defines
a
good
person
and
do
good
people
ever
behave
in
a
bad
way
some
day
a
ceo
will
swoop
down
and
make
him
rich
trickle
down
is
real
of
course
there
is
a
promise
of
money
that
s
how
the
reward
system
works
are
we
talking
about
the
same
thing
here
less
than
2
of
workers
make
minimum
wage
im
in

and
our

s
here
pay
20
bucks
hr
not
sure
if
altoona
is
that
high
but
it
definitely
ain
t
min
wage
there
s
nothing
nuanced
about
the
assassination
there
is
no
need
to
publicly
sympathize
with
his
motivations
because
this
cannot
be
a
tool
for
change
our
healthcare
system
is
broken
and
needs
to
changed
in
no
way
does
that
fact
need
to
be
given
any
more
merit
on
the
murderers
behalf
maybe
they
all
took
down
their
staff
pages
didn
t
they
they
re
afraid
of
copy
cats
now
that
this
guy
has
become
a
hero
what
is
with
reddit
today
everyone
s
got
a
stick
up
their
ass
nah
it
s
cringy
the
hot
dogs
who
is
santa
goawayok
no
knowledge
i
know
what
happened
during
the
event
and
the
issues
leading
up
to
it
surely
that
counts
as
some
knowledge
if
a
child
begs
their
parent
to
let
them
drink
alcohol
and
the
parent
allows
them
and
something
happens
to
the
child
do
you
blame
the
child
or
the
parents
lobbyists
only
have
as
much
power
as
the
government
allows
them
to
have
you
blame
the
lobbyists
for
removing
the
public
option
why
not
blame
the
elected
officials
who
allowed
it
to
happen
and
actually
removed
it
you
say
we
re
going
to
be
ruled
by
billionaires
for
the
next
for
years
how
is
that
different
from
the
last
30
40
50
would
it
have
been
any
different
with
kamala
in
charge
i
can
completely
understand
not
being
very
broken
up
about
this
guy
dying
but
at
the
same
time
people
cannot
be
allowed
to
protest
by
going
around
and
shooting
other
people
in
the
back
especially
when
the
target
wasn
t
even
really
the
one
responsible
every
healthcare
company
in
the
us
does
the
exact
same
thing
as
this
guy
s
company
as
long
as
healthcare
is
as
much
of
a
business
as
it
is
that
will
never
change
change
has
to
come
from
the
government
in
this
case
and
this
will
do
nothing
to
inspire
that
change
i
m
not
blaming
the
victims
at
all
i
m
all
for
sticking
it
to
the
man
violence
is
always
last
resort
though
real
change
does
not
start
this
way
regrettably
it
often
does
a
protest
is
ultimately
a
threat
of
force
through
numbers
if
different
options
are
tried
and
they
don
t
work
the
last
resort
is
violence
if
you
or
a
loved
one
s
life
was
on
the
line
because
of
an
idiotic
policy
would
you
just
sit
there
and
say
this
is
an
acceptable
loss
hopefully
someday
someone
will
be
elected
who
actually
cares
about
helping
no
you
ll
be
angry
if
enough
angry
people
are
created
some
are
bound
to
be
violent
the
rich
have
so
much
political
and
media
influence
considering
the
tools
they
have
if
they
truly
do
not
want
something
to
happen
it
won
t
don
t
blame
the
least
powerful
people
for
where
we
are
if
billionaires
wanted
things
to
be
different
they
have
the
means
to
make
it
happen
these
are
the
circumstances
that
they
created
stop
blaming
the
least
powerful
parts
of
society
for
natural
consequences
of
the
status
quo
people
are
rightfully
upset
a
few
of
those
rightfully
upset
people
will
resort
to
violence
since
there
are
so
many
the
likelihood
of
that
would
be
decreased
by
decreasing
the
sample
of
rightfully
upset
people
love
that
man
but
bernie
and
others
like
him
will
never
win
a
fair
race
real
change
has
always
started
with
violence
nope
he
s
a
scum
bag
but
he
s
taking
advantage
of
our
late
stage
capitalism
she
was
passed
out
he
was
just
taking
advantage
of
the
situation
it
s
not
like
he
had
to
hold
her
down
and
cover
her
mouth
or
anything
it
was
just
a
few
minutes
of
action
what
s
the
big
deal
there
s
no
grand
evil
leader
everyone
could
be
described
as
taking
advantage
of
the
situation
your
reasoning
is
highly
motivated
removed
there
is
no
ruling
class
lol
what
are
you
a
14
year
old
that
just
took
their
first
civics
class
an
underpaid
campaign
worker
doing
astroturfing
in
a
warehouse
in
delaware
maybe
a
bot
i
d
be
interested
to
see
the
answers
you
would
have
received
if
you
asked
people
to
describe
a
happy
life
100
years
ago
versus
today
i
don
t
really
subscribe
to
the
idea
this
problem
can
be
legislated
away
at
least
in
any
practical
manor
americans
have
a
real
worship
of
money
and
it
s
deep
seated
the
influence
of
capitalism
is
just
too
strong
with
its
promise
that
anyone
with
enough
luck
and
the
right
moves
could
become
a
king
as
people
move
up
the
ladder
and
get
closer
to
that
bag
whether
they
are
politicians
or
in
business
it
becomes
too
tempting
to
step
on
others
maybe
it
was
the
threat
of
eternal
damnation
in
previous
generations
that
kept
people
from
being
as
greedy
maybe
advances
in
advertising
in
the
40
50s
tweaked
the
formula
just
right
to
infect
the
psyche
maybe
i
m
just
not
knowledgeable
about
the
extent
of
greedy
robber
barons
of
yesteryear
and
it
s
in
fact
always
been
this
way
i
just
have
this
creeping
suspicion
without
a
massive
cultural
overhaul
of
our
values
system
things
aren
t
gonna
get
better
the
specific
times
i
can
think
to
call
the
cops
is
after
being
robbed
when
i
had
to
file
a
police
report
so
insurance
would
pay
up
idk
what
they
thought
you
would
say
cops
aren
t
superheroes
when
they
do
save
people
it
s
because
of
a
confluence
of
circumstances
that
allowed
it
to
happen
if
someone
isn
t
a
child
they
know
that
cops
are
law
enforcement
the
emt
s
and
firefighters
actually
save
people
but
that
doesn
t
give
goodtimezappa
those
powerful
daddy
feelings
that
raw
violence
does
as
it
should
be
lol
what
this
is
already
happening
on
fox
news
the
talking
heads
there
were
saying
yesterday
how
insurance
is
only
so
unaffordable
because
of
obamacare
that
it
s
not
the
insurance
companies
fault
claims
get
denied
it
s
all
because
of
obamacare
the
russian
trolls
have
reorientated
themselves
in
that
sub
i
haven
t
seen
a
single
post
on
any
conservative
forum
in
which
this
has
happened
you
re
a
bot
why
are
you
lying
the
third
post
is
about
this
guy
and
the
top
comments
are
all
sympathetic
ah
but
we
know
that
satan
loves
them
more
and
will
give
them
the
hot
slide
ride
to
hell
when
the
time
comes
no
matter
how
big
of
a
pile
of
money
they
have
this
is
untrue
for
anyone
passing
by
and
seeing
this
sounds
like
an
evil
cartoon
caricature
of
a
republican
chine
bot
or
russian
yes
and
you
re
stupid
if
you
don
t
see
the
difference
at
all
no
one
was
attacking
rittenhouse
until
he
started
pointing
an
automatic
weapon
at
people
protesting
peacefully
i
feel
like
we
are
arguing
the
same
point
here
you
vote
not
guilty
if
you
decide
to
not
convict
someone
the
point
is
that
a
juror
can
deliberately
and
legally
choose
to
vote
not
guilty
even
if
they
know
the
accused
committed
the
crime
that
s
literally
what
nullification
is
any
why
there
isn
t
a
lot
of
info
just
decide
they
did
it
but
bike
not
guilty
then
can
t
talk
about
it
all
you
get
is
a
not
guilty
verdict
the
judge
could
claim
no
reasonable
jury
could
come
to
that
conclusion
and
enter
a
judgment
notwithstanding
the
verdict
the
guy
is
going
to
prison
for
sure
single
jurors
can
effect
sentencing
though
let
me
know
possible
outcomes
but
i
know
that
in
places
that
have
the
death
penalty
a
unanimous
decision
is
required
a
jury
was
willing
to
nullify
oj
simpson
killing
his
beautiful
and
innocent
wife
in
part
because
some
jurors
saw
acquitting
oj
as
payback
for
rodney
king
so
something
far
less
controversial
like
someone
that
looks
ambiguously
like
luigi
assassinating
this
publicly
reviled
insurance
ceo
who
oversaw
the
use
of
ai
to
deny
claims
might
also
be
nullified

but
the
prosecution
and
law
enforcement
will
try
much
harder
to
protect
rich
ceos
than
they
do
most
random
murder
victims
like
nicole
brown
so
that
does
hamper
the
odds
of
jury
nullification
for
luigi
even
just
forcing
a
retrial
would
likely
prolong
increased
public
awareness
and
scrutiny
of
the
us
healthcare
and
insurance
system
s
failures
so
that
s
still
a
worthwhile
outcome
i
m
sure
you
re
being
facetious
but
i
ll
respond
this
person
just
said
that
there
is
zero
chance
i
e
no
chance
of
jury
nullification
zero
the
probability
of
any
one
person
coming
into
existence
is
quite
low
however
i
am
a
person
and
i
am
responding
to
a
person
or
at
least
a
product
of
an
llm
created
by
people
neat
right
well
jury
nullification
in
this
case
is
much
more
probable
than
our
existence
does
this
only
apply
to
civil
trials
the
linked
wikipedia
article
mentions
civil
but
not
criminal
trials
would
this
apply
to
a
criminal
trial
as
a
middle
aged
man
who
uses
no
social
media
beyond
reddit
i
am
not
sure
what
age
or
ticktoc
has
to
do
with
this
but
ok
as
i
also
stated
this
isn
t
a
sure
thing
but
could
happen
i
am
happy
to
know
more
if
there
is
something
specific
that
i
am
unaware
of
wdym
it
literally
is
an
escape
route
first
you
have
to
be
18
to
be
a
juror
so
the
entire
potential
juror
pool
aren
t
17
year
olds
on
tiktok
second
all
the
jurors
just
have
to
agree
that
they
don
t
think
he
should
be
convicted
they
all
vote
not
guilty
end
of
story
yeah
both
myself
30s
and
literally
every
single
person
i
know
friend
or
family
ages
20
75
mostly
older
have
vehemently
stated
they
would
vote
not
guilty
dude
is
a
hero
everyone
who
isn
t
a
boot
licking
class
traitor
or
wealthy
person
shaking
in
their
boots
knows
it
hoping
to
see
more
copycat
killers
rising
up
to
put
some
real
fear
into
there
guys
if
for
no
other
reason
than
to
get
the
media
to
call
off
their
search
for
the
motive
lmfao
you
re
right
you
have
to
be
18
to
be
on
a
jury
if
even
matt
walsh
s
audience
is
pro
shooter
then
we
re
looking
across
the
political
and
identity
spectrum
for
people
being
pro
shooter
there
s
probably
not
a
person
in
america
who
hasn
t
or
doesn
t
know
someone
affected
by
the
profitization
of
our
healthcare
system
you
don
t
need
to
know
the
term
to
apply
the
principle
not
someone
but
bossman
of
the
biggest
leech
operation
in
america
bootlicker
another
one
gobbling
up
the
mass
media
narrative
like
a
glutton
it
s
a
bit
sad
but
it
is
what
it
is
but
he
was
26
off
his
parents
health
insurance
and
had
to
deal
with
the
shitty
american
healthcare
system
himself
he
had
typical
tech
bro
politics
until
his
back
injury
where
he
got
super
radicalized
and
decided
to
take
it
out
on
the
ceo
of
a
health
insurance
company
just
calling
every
shooter
a
crazy
lunatic
just
handwaves
all
killings
would
you
call
isreal
soldiers
mentally
ill
cause
they
kill
innocent
civilians
right
looks
like
you
re
clearly
gobbling
up
the
media
spin
to
make
him
out
to
be
a
deranged
guy
rather
than
someone
trying
to
provide
revolutionary
momentum
eat
it
up
i
m
kind
of
jealous
mine
are
all
conservative
christian
except
for
a
few
like
trump
held
up
a
bible
and
that
was
it
for
them
if
you
think
the
maga
folks
are
the
only
ones
celebrating
this
you
re
sadly
mistaken
hating
insurance
execs
spans
both
sides
of
the
aisle
do
you
think
only
rightwing
nutjobs
are
sympathizing
with
whoever
the
shooter
was
that
s
not
what
s
going
on
uh
huh
looks
like
you
re
gobbling
up
the
nytimes
mass
media
messaging
like
candy
i
m
a
progressive
not
a
trump
supporter
class
traitor
is
100
a
thing
as
evidenced
at
that
mcdonalds
guessing
you
re
a
privileged
boy
or
a
weird
bootlicker
circumventing
the
law
for
good
reasons
is
the
same
as
circumventing
the
law
for
bad
reasons
i
only
watched
episodes
here
and
there
back
in
the
90s
but
that
one
sounds
a
bit
interesting
thanks
for
the
recommendation
people
who
read
stories
of
conspiracy
racketeering
and
manipulation
can
often
form
a
fixed
model
of
how
they
things
the
undeterminable
facts
are
in
reality
given
that
they
will
never
know
them
due
to
airtight
conspiracy
in
comparison
true
crime
buffs
are
not
this
way
since
they
often
see
a
story
having
reachable
outcomes
conspiracy
theories
are
not
partisan
at
all
there
are
some
people
who
think
all
conspiracy
theories
eventually
reduce
to
antisemitic
talking
points
and
i
am
not
one
of
them
part
of
the
reason
the
prosecutors
dismissed
jurors
who
liked
the
x
files
is
because
there
was
an
anti
death
penalty
episode
and
they
wanted
to
and
ultimately
did
give
mcveigh
death
by
lethal
injection
i
mention
it
because
the
liberal
leanings
of
the
show
were
part
of
the
reason
it
affected
jury
selection
you
will
get
pulled
from
juries
because
of
your
political
opinions
if
you
don
t
think
the
state
should
have
the
right
to
execute
people
you
can
t
serve
on
a
jury
that
is
effectively
also
a
death
panel
and
lawyers
on
both
sides
are
going
to
be
doing
their
best
to
weed
people
like
you
out
because
jury
issues
can
result
in
a
mistrial
which
no
one
wants
to
be
honest
it
s
part
of
a
lawyer
s
job
to
be
keen
enough
to
pick
out
people
like
you
lol
they
are
very
tactical
with
their
questions
and
watch
your
mannerisms
this
would
be
a
massive
waste
of
our
tax
dollars
and
we
ve
already
wasted
way
more
than
necessary
you
d
think
related
to
a
cop
usually
gets
you
bumped
though
by
both
sides
voir
dire
isn
t
as
rigorous
in
cases
of
low
publicity
and
importance
that
doesn
t
apply
here
no
under
the
aca
excess
profits
have
to
be
returned
to
the
policy
holders
that
s
why
some
people
get
a
check
for
100
or
something
once
a
year
from
their
health
insurance
company
in
western
pa
both
major
insurers
upmc
and
highmark
are
not
for
profit
status
meaning
they
are
allowed
to
make
some
small
amount
of
profit
for
company
development
purposes
like
enough
to
keep
computer
systems
upgraded
open
a
new
branch
that
sort
of
thing
but
anything
beyond
that
amount
has
to
be
spent
on
programs
that
benefit
the
community
so
for
example
highmark
has
a
facility
called
the
caring
place
that
provides
free
services
and
support
for
children
who
have
lost
a
parent
or
sibling
and
one
of
the
funding
sources
is
highmark
excess
profits
when
they
exist
upmc
has
or
had
a
scholarship
for
kids
who
graduate
from
pittsburgh
public
schools
that
also
came
from
that
sort
of
funding
those
sorts
of
things
that
really
isn
t
true
at
least
for
us
pennsylvanians
the
two
big
healthcare
giants
in
our
state
are
highmark
and
ahn
they
are
both
nonprofit
organizations
in
that
there
is
no
shareholders
that
the
profits
go
towards
if
you
live
in
downtown
pittsburgh
a
good
chunk
of
anything
having
to
deal
with
charities
culture
district
activities
and
more
come
from
these
two
corporations
and
yet
healthcare
is
not
magically
cheap
and
they
still
do
plenty
of
shitty
practices
you
are
misdiagnosing
the
problem
most
of
my
family
either
works
in
healthcare
or
for
the
two
health
insurance
firms
even
without
a
profit
motive
the
higher
ups
still
care
more
about
maintaining
their
share
of
the
market
or
influencing
policies
and
and
public
opinion
through
which
charities
they
donate
to
over
reinvesting
to
make
healthcare
more
affordable
to
their
users
this
is
why
i
find
the
outrage
on
here
so
stupid
and
maintain
people
either
are
ignorant
of
how
things
work
or
don
t
live
in
pa
because
if
you
had
any
knowledge
of
how
healthcare
works
in
our
state
you
would
know
it
isn
t
billionaires
or
investors
fucking
people
over
because
they
literally
do
not
exist
in
those
companies
they
fuck
us
over
because
they
are
an
institution
that
wants
to
maintain
their
own
market
share
influence
and
importance
yeah
it
affects
people
to
a
different
degree
i
d
like
to
see
some
coverage
satisfaction
data
but
i
imagine
nyc
has
a
higher
concentration
of
satisfied
citizens
i
don
t
think
america
is
either
health
insurance
has
been
a
healthcare
issue
for
decades
and
there
s
been
one
person
to
take
action
i
m
surprised
it
hadn
t
happened
sooner
everyone
is
satisfied
unless
they
get
sick
or
have
a
problem
then
no
one
is
happy
it
takes
multiple
appointments
and
months
of
scheduling
procedures
which
your
insurance
company
turns
down
arbitrarily
it
s
a
bunch
of
bullshit
for
people
that
are
sick
and
need
help
run
ins
or
not
we
re
paying
more
for
less
they
continue
to
enshittify
our
healthcare
system
and
also
there
s
plenty
who
have
with
still
more
who
loved
them
and
remember
the
for
profit
bullshit
they
suffered
he
meant
for
being
thrown
in
jail
for
bringing
up
the
topic
not
sure
if
it
rises
to
the
level
of
contempt
depending
on
what
you
say
how
it
s
said
the
journalists
are
providing
information
and
law
enforcement
has
literally
no
reason
to
lie
about
this
the
killer
s
family
is
also
not
lying
you
seem
like
an
instigator
who
is
just
making
up
his
own
theories
to
get
people
with
grievances
riled
up
and
on
your
side
i
am
not
making
up
any
theories
i
am
not
saying
my
bet
is
this
or
that
like
you
are
doing
people
who
make
up
their
own
stories
are
always
saying
authorities
are
lying
therefore
they
are
justified
to
put
their
own
theories
center
stage
in
the
story
we
re
discussing
luigi
is
the
hero
he
s
the
good
guy
100
a
hero
dude
he
s
gen
z
and
has
severe
back
pain
of
course
he
has
mental
illness
they
just
say
rewards
up
to
xxxx
they
never
say
we
promise
to
give
you
money
if
you
give
us
information
they
don
t
have
to
give
you
any
money
and
given
they
make
clear
criteria
such
as
you
must
call
this
number
and
provide
the
information
there
they
make
sure
they
can
make
it
as
hard
as
possible
to
get
the
reward
it
s
the
public
reaction
to
the
murder
that
begs
acknowledgement
that
s
the
nuance
pretending
it
doesn
t
exist
is
disingenuous
at
best
that
is
your
subjective
opinion
don
t
forget
your
tea
with
it
ya
not
what
i
said
at
all
it
s
crazy
that
i
m
being
downvoted
on
here
cold
blooded
murder
isn
t
ok
people
they
ll
find
out
real
quick
if
obamacare
gets
over
turned
and
suddenly
everything
is
a
pre
existing
condition
indeed
popped
in
just
to
see
there
s
a
lot
of
we
re
the
party
of
law
and
order
and
the
sick
left
wing
are
the
only
ones
who
support
this
there
s
a
little
pushback
in
the
comments
which
is
getting
upvotes
but
not
much
vocal
support
just
like
with
jan
6
they
didn
t
know
what
to
think
and
a
lot
of
them
started
condemning
the
insurrectionists
once
the
talking
heads
spread
their
marching
orders
they
quickly
fell
in
line
your
account
name
is
randomly
generated
one
month
old
and
jerking
off
jordan
peterson
if
anyone
is
a
bot
here
it
s
you
it
s
not
a
real
person
it
s
a
bot
that
s
trying
to
prevent
class
consciousness
from
taking
place
or
a
neoliberal
no
difference
really
because
most
of
the
time
it
is
republicans
are
cartoon
villains
their
fucking
glorious
leader
is
a
rapist
he
had
an
automatic
weapon
this
is
actually
not
true
and
the
facts
of
the
case
prove
as
much
the
prosecution
were
not
able
to
show
any
evidence
that
kyle
pointed
a
rifle
at
anyone
prior
to
them
attacking
him
pro
tip
don
t
attack
a
guy
that
s
carrying
a
gun
jnov
is
only
applicable
in
civil
trials
or
in
criminal
trials
where
the
jury
finds
the
defendant
guilty
if
the
jury
finds
the
defendant
not
guilty
the
judge
can
t
do
shit
about
it
no
they
can
t
everyone
has
a
right
to
trial
by
jury
a
bench
trial
is
a
thing
but
the
defendant
would
have
to
agree
to
it
new
york
does
not
have
the
death
penalty
that
case
had
at
least
enough
incompetence
from
the
prosecution
that
they
had
not
proved
the
case
beyond
reasonable
doubt
to
some
and
had
an
active
feud
between
the
jury
and
the
court
it
was
also
a
super
racially
biased
jury
and
they
did
a
bad
job
picking
them
i
think
that
the
jury
here
will
be
at
best
much
more
diverse
and
at
worst
biased
to
wealthy
and
conservative
people
if
they
can
manage
it
what
the
fuck
are
you
even
talking
about
as
a
middle
aged
man
who
does
use
tic
tok
i
have
no
clue
what
he
s
on
about
either
social
media
like
anything
else
is
all
in
what
you
use
it
for
i
ve
actually
learned
a
lot
from
that
site
i
see
something
interesting
i
go
check
it
out
sometimes
it
s
b
s
a
lot
of
times
i
learn
something
new
i
think
they
were
just
saying
it
s
not
likely
to
happen
i
ll
say
it
nicer
it
s
possible
but
so
is
my
dick
growing
3
inches
overnight
this
guy
will
probably
be
convicted
on
everything
they
can
find
and
lawfully
he
should
if
that
s
even
the
killer
my
bullshit
meter
is
off
the
charts
i
would
honestly
be
shocked
if
they
even
have
the
right
guy
or
even
if
they
do
if
they
have
enough
evidence
to
convict
yeah
that
s
not
gonna
happen
it
s
pretty
obvious
he
did
the
crime
and
they
re
going
to
easily
convict
him
besides
with
these
shootings
it
s
almost
never
some
vigilante
revolutionary
it
s
just
some
insane
person
who
thinks
the
easter
bunny
ordered
them
to
do
it
the
guy
s
family
was
richer
than
the
ceos
lol
and
that
s
why
you
would
get
removed
from
the
jury
pool
i
fully
believe
he
had
it
coming
i
also
do
think
objectively
he
was
intentionally
killed
that
is
seperate
from
me
laughing
at
his
death
and
if
the
jury
pool
is
composed
of
20
something
social
media
users
you
may
have
a
point
i
m
not
opposed
to
nullification
or
leniency
or
a
pardon
or
anything
along
those
lines
personally
i
also
live
in
the
real
world
that
8
of
these
12
jurors
are
going
to
be
grandmothers
and
underemployed
who
probably
watch
fox
news
and
have
never
been
on
reddit
yeah
everyone
who
doesn
t
want
to
live
in
a
country
where
broad
daylight
executions
with
no
judge
or
jury
are
allowed
is
a
bootlicker
you
got
me
you
re
telling
me
a
26
yr
old
ivy
league
grad
data
scientist
from
a
rich
real
estate
family
with
political
connections
just
did
this
out
of
the
blue
no
he
had
some
sort
of
psychotic
break
a
few
months
ago
and
completely
disappeared
from
family
and
friends
the
guy
clearly
had
underlying
issues
the
lefties
who
are
celebrating
are
the
ones
who
didn
t
turn
out
because
of
palestine
which
is
to
say
maga
in
camo
green
hat
wasn
t
working
class
by
any
remotely
marxist
definition
of
the
term
just
another
prissy
rich
kid
pretending
to
engage
in
vanguardism
anti
death
penalty
myself
the
only
conspiracy
theorists
i
ve
come
across
have
been
right
wingers
but
oh
well
agreed
i
love
a
good
conspiracy
theory
but
the
ones
i
believe
in
don
t
actually
kill
other
people
not
trusting
what
archeologists
say
about
when
something
may
have
been
built
is
far
different
than
not
trusting
a
large
majority
of
scientists
when
it
comes
to
disease
control
nah
i
d
slip
past
questioning
easily
but
in
cases
like
this
they
probably
scan
socials
etc
and
though
i
do
what
i
can
to
protect
myself
i
m
sure
they
d
find
signs
of
well
a
lack
of
bootlicking
the
upmc
heath
plan
which
is
separate
from
the
hospitals
is
their
insurance
arm
is
a
for
profit
corporation
and
pays
taxes
ahn
isn
t
an
insurer
it
s
a
hospital
network
owned
by
highmark
yeah
until
you
get
seriously
sick
or
injured
yeah
and
they
can
also
arbitrarily
deny
in
the
middle
after
approving
too
absolutely
i
hate
our
healthcare
system
my
point
is
more
just
people
without
health
problems
are
probably
going
to
be
their
pick
like
i
ve
never
been
denied
personally
but
i
ve
seen
plenty
of
patients
get
denied
its
also
designed
to
be
discouraged
from
using
actual
insurance
to
they
make
the
preniums
or
monthlys
high
so
you
wont
end
up
using
the
insurance
to
cover
medication
appt
or
procedure
which
eats
into
thier
profits
people
are
literally
paying
insurance
to
not
use
it
also
they
raise
rates
for
the
older
group
and
people
that
chronically
ill
too
most
people
in
western
pa
are
insured
by
not
for
profit
health
insurance
companies
so
yes
because
america
is
easily
represented
by
the
sunday
revolutionaries
of
reddit
and
it
will
definitely
be
difficult
to
find
new
york
citizens
who
still
believe
in
the
rule
of
law
yeah
i
m
familiar
with
the
concept
but
not
that
most
people
who
reference
it
are
jailed
you
forgot
to
put
quotes
around
journslists
you
sound
like
someone
who
would
have
defended
law
enforcement
and
the
media
when
they
dragged
richard
jewell
i
m
sorry
how
do
you
define
hero
and
how
do
you
define
vigilante
luigi
is
the
literal
definition
of
a
vigilante
a
hero
it
s
not
like
he
saved
anyone
and
he
was
not
at
all
courageous
shooting
someone
in
the
back
is
not
an
act
of
courage
he
s
also
not
a
role
model
for
your
children
vigilante
justice
is
anti
democratic
anti
american
they
have
directly
addressed
the
public
reaction
and
condemned
it
what
more
acknowledgment
do
you
want
they
don
t
sympathize
with
the
toxic
internet
mob
cheering
for
a
guy
who
hid
with
a
gun
waiting
to
shoot
a
father
of
two
in
the
back
and
undoubtedly
will
bully
his
children
into
committing
suicide
one
day
the
public
reaction
has
been
abhorrent
the
end
i
was
a
teenage
anarchist
looking
for
a
revolution
it
hits
different
from
the
can
removed
they
are
morons
it
s
like
they
completely
forgot
what
it
was
like
prior
to
aca
and
insurers
could
charge
women
twice
as
much
as
men
because
they
were
of
child
bearing
age
and
therefore
might
cost
more
with
a
pregnancy
and
also
deny
coverage
for
any
pre
existing
condition
as
someone
who
has
anxiety
depression
hypothyroidism
autoimmune
disease
congenital
heart
defect
i
m
toast
if
aca
goes
away
and
there
are
millions
more
who
are
probably
even
worse
off
than
i
why
cherry
pick
like
this
i
just
checked
that
sub
and
plenty
of
people
still
supportive
of
him
it
takes
60
seconds
to
verify
what
on
odd
thing
to
say
the
prosecution
also
were
not
allowed
to
refer
to
the
dead
people
as
victims
so
it
would
not
surprise
me
if
all
the
videos
showing
him
pointing
a
gun
at
people
weren
t
allowed
to
be
presented
did
not
know
this
part
thanks
for
the
heads
up
you
may
be
right
but
i
think
you
may
be
underestimating
the
widespread
resentment
that
people
have
against
health
insurance
and
the
healthcare
industry
as
a
whole
the
us
has
one
of
the
most
expensive
healthcare
systems
and
despite
that
that
cost
these
companies
are
still
prioritizing
profits
over
the
health
of
the
country

a
conviction
requires
a
unanimous
vote
only
one
juror
can
prevent
a
conviction
from
happening
didn
t
say
whether
it
d
happen
or
not
was
just
refuting
that
it
really
is
an
escape
route
and
an
option
that
the
jury
can
take
even
though
basically
any
admission
or
talk
of
it
during
the
case
will
get
you
dismissed
you
believe
the
ceo
had
it
coming
and
that
he
was
intentionally
killed
i
mean
yeah
those
are
the
facts
just
a
bit
confused
how
that
is
a
response
to
what
i
said
well
the
way
things
are
going
it
s
looking
like
the
choices
are
basically
either
put
up
with
capitalism
descending
into
fascist
oligarchy
or
you
can
take
up
arms
and
do
something
about
it
the
second
definition
of
tyranny
listed
on
google
is
cruel
unreasonable
or
arbitrary
use
of
power
or
control
in
what
way
do
the
arbitrary
claim
denials
costing
lives
and
livelihoods
not
meet
that
definition
the
tree
of
liberty
must
be
regularly
watered
with
the
blood
of
partriots
and
tyrants
it
s
getting
thirsty
and
it
s
the
basis
our
country
was
founded
upon
caused
by
his
back
injury
after
his
back
injury
he
shut
himself
off
from
his
family
for
7
months
while
he
was
reading
books
on
back
pain
and
how
to
handle
it
it
was
very
obvious
what
radicalized
him
and
just
blowing
it
all
off
like
oh
he
was
always
just
crazy
no
normal
person
would
shoot
someone
else
let
s
ignore
the
entire
circumstances
that
drove
him
to
this
problem
and
let
s
just
blame
mental
health
but
not
actually
fix
mental
health
it
s
the
same
cop
out
every
time
there
s
a
school
shooting
and
only
the
us
tries
to
fix
this
crisis
with
thoughts
and
prayers
and
only
the
us
has
so
many
school
shootings
yes
as
only
political
people
only
had
insurance
claims
denied
because
the
doctors
ask
for
your
stance
when
you
fill
your
forms
out
no
normal
apolitical
person
ever
been
denied
life
saving
treatment
or
their
families
like
young
kids
ever
you
can
go
and
shill
somewhere
else
conspiracies
were
originally
on
the
left
as
well
but
they
all
moved
to
the
right
winger
side
with
the
anti
vaxx
covid
movement
during
the
pandemic
i
ve
met
some
lefty
conspiracy
theorists
they
seem
to
gravitate
towards
communism
there
are
a
lot
of
those
sorry
for
the
long
reply
i
meant
upmc
my
bad
on
that
but
the
point
still
stands
you
do
realize
non
profit
means
they
use
thier
revenue
for
operational
cost
it
doesnt
mean
they
dont
do
it
for
nothing
they
sitll
get
thier
money
from
somewhere
i
think
there
are
laws
about
how
and
when
jurors
are
allowed
to
be
informed
about
it
so
for
example
a
defense
attorney
who
mentioned
it
when
they
weren
t
allowed
to
may
be
found
in
contempt
of
court
you
forgot
to
check
your
spelling
you
sound
like
an
idiot
but
sure
keep
trying
to
define
me
i
am
a
person
who
doesn
t
subscribe
to
guesses
and
theories
this
courageous
hero
is
a
role
model
for
children
he
saw
someone
responsible
for
the
deaths
of
thousands
and
took
action
men
like
that
get
statues
built
of
them
people
like
this
guy
and
the
cop
that
murdered
george
floyd
and
then
got
stabbed
in
prison
should
consider
a
simple
life
lesson
you
should
lead
a
life
of
quality
at
least
to
the
extent
that
people
don
t
celebrate
when
you
re
stabbed
or
killed
you
know
all
those
hypotheticals
about
if
you
could
go
back
in
time
would
you
kill
hitler
luigi
did
it
well
not
a
teenager
or
an
anarchist
on
my
end
you
re
about
22
to
28
years
off
you
should
be
copying
and
pasting
the
one
without
the
spelling
error
keep
saying
it
and
maybe
it
will
be
true
they
forgot
about
covid
so
naturally
they
don
t
remember
pre
afordable
care
act
because
they
re
either
bots
or
neoliberals
no
difference
really
trying
to
keep
us
divided
between
red
and
blue
and
prevent
class
consciousness
it
would
not
surprise
me
if
all
the
videos
showing
him
pointing
a
gun
at
people
weren
t
allowed
to
be
presented
okay
well
that
wasn
t
the
case
lol
they
in
fact
did
try
to
present
a
video
showing
that
this
happened
but
it
was
entirely
unconvincing
to
the
jury
because
it
was
from
hundreds
of
meters
away
enhanced
by
ai
and
you
couldn
t
make
out
that
it
actually
was
kyle
even
if
it
were
true
to
begin
with
it
would
not
have
likely
changed
the
self
defense
claim
kyle
was
running
away
from
everyone
with
his
back
turned
when
he
was
attacked
let
me
say
this
unfortunately
i
believe
i
m
right
i
have
massive
grievances
against
the
health
care
industry
i
have
been
denied
medications
based
on
insurance
and
or
no
prior
authorization
because
i
hadn
t
tried
medications
that
had
horrific
side
effects
also
i
still
have
my
doubts
on
this
dude
being
the
one
my
conspiracy
mind
can
rave
at
times
but
there
is
so
much
that
is
not
making
sense
on
this
edit
whoever
did
it
should
be
held
accountable
if
it
was
him
it
s
second
degree
murder
he
will
be
out
in
time
to
see
his
own
netflix
series
that
s
why
it
s
called
justice
because
it
s
just
us
that
ll
just
lead
to
a
mistrial
though
one
i
suspect
the
government
is
willing
to
take
a
few
extra
cracks
at
that
doesn
t
automatically
acquit
the
accused
because
they
re
both
facts
that
can
exist
simultaneously
the
law
is
the
law
it
doesn
t
matter
what
anyone
thinks
or
feels
law
is
not
based
on
feelings
it
is
based
on
facts
the
jury
selection
process
will
be
so
thorough
and
eliminate
wishy
washy
weirdos
and
such
it
is
not
normal
to
have
back
surgery
and
then
completely
disassociate
from
society
for
7
months
to
plan
to
murder
a
healthcare
ceo
they
are
explicitly
limited
in
how
much
profit
they
can
make
anything
beyond
a
certain
relatively
small
amount
has
to
be
put
into
community
projects
like
college
scholarships
for
kids
who
graduate
from
the
local
school
system
in
addition
a
ton
of
people
are
employed
by
the
two
major
health
insurance
companies
both
of
whom
are
not
for
profit
so
they
re
not
super
likely
to
be
thrilled
with
the
idea
of
themselves
or
a
loved
one
getting
shot
just
for
trying
to
go
to
work
or
being
at
work
yeah
but
i
m
drunk
what
s
your
excuse
lol
you
don
t
sound
like
you
subscribe
to
thinking
go
flip
on
the
news
again
they
have
more
opinions
for
you
to
call
your
own
r
cringe
that
only
makes
it
worse
true
but
i
doubt
it
will
go
beyond
3
a
second
trial
would
be
certain
though
and
with
the
right
defense
it
would
get
harder
and
harder
to
find
a
jury
willing
to
convict
because
this
is
going
to
be
a
high
profile
trial
with
lots
of
opportunities
to
build
public
sympathy
it
s
typically
just
as
good
though
for
this
case
they
might
try
a
few
times
but
i
doubt
they
will
go
to
a
fourth
trial
if
it
comes
to
it
his
defense
will
likely
try
to
build
public
sympathy
during
his
trial
which
will
make
it
harder
and
harder
to
to
find
a
jury
that
will
land
a
conviction
yea
its
not
normal
but
it
could
happen
to
anyone
it
s
not
all
because
he
was
crazy
or
something
he
was
smart
got
a
masters
degree
in
computer
science
with
an
emphasis
in
ai
and
got
a
good
job
in
the
field
he
read
plenty
of
books
and
was
just
radicalized
by
being
fucked
over
we
should
be
talking
about
fixing
the
system
where
one
bad
surgery
wouldn
t
cause
one
person
to
feel
so
fucked
over
that
the
only
recourse
they
think
they
have
is
to
kill
someone
not
just
ignore
it
and
go
well
he
waa
just
fucked
up
let
s
move
on
and
ignore
any
systemic
issues
in
society
that
could
have
caused
this
to
the
feds
i
ll
keep
this
short
because
i
do
respect
what
you
do
for
our
country
to
save
you
a
lengthy
investigation
i
state
plainly
that
i
wasn
t
working
with
anyone
this
was
fairly
trivial
some
elementary
social
engineering
basic
cad
a
lot
of
patience
the
spiral
notebook
if
present
has
some
straggling
notes
and
to
do
lists
that
illuminate
the
gist
of
it
my
tech
is
pretty
locked
down
because
i
work
in
engineering
so
probably
not
much
info
there
i
do
apologize
for
any
strife
of
traumas
but
it
had
to
be
done
frankly
these
parasites
simply
had
it
coming
a
reminder
the
us
has
the
1
most
expensive
healthcare
system
in
the
world
yet
we
rank
roughly
42
in
life
expectancy
united
is
the
indecipherable
largest
company
in
the
us
by
market
cap
behind
only
apple
google
walmart
it
has
grown
and
grown
but
as
our
life
expectancy
no
the
reality
is
these
indecipherable
have
simply
gotten
too
powerful
and
they
continue
to
abuse
our
country
for
immense
profit
because
the
american
public
has
allwed
them
to
get
away
with
it
obviously
the
problem
is
more
complex
but
i
do
not
have
space
and
frankly
i
do
not
pretend
to
be
the
most
qualified
person
to
lay
out
the
full
argument
but
many
have
illuminated
the
corruption
and
greed
e
g
rosenthal
moore
decades
ago
and
the
problems
simply
remain
it
is
not
an
issue
of
awareness
at
this
point
but
clearly
power
games
at
play
evidently
i
am
the
first
to
face
it
with
such
brutal
honesty
my
excuse
for
what
so
monday
night
and
you
re
drunk
sounds
like
a
problem
to
me
yeah
sure
i
have
not
written
even
one
opinion
on
this
thread
not
one
how
about
you
flip
open
a
newspaper
or
book
or
is
your
new
favorite
author
ted
kaczynski
glad
to
see
i
live
in
your
head
rent
free
poor
you
the
only
reason
i
m
even
doing
this
back
is
cause
i
m
bored
and
have
nothing
better
to
do
for
the
rest
of
the
day
perks
of
being
self
employed
edit
the
person
who
commented
that
they
live
with
their
parents
i
pity
them
that
s
a
sad
existence
and
another
subjective
opinion
was
ted
kaczynski
a
well
adjusted
person
you
know
what
you
did
the
journalists
are
providing
information
and
law
enforcement
has
literally
no
reason
to
lie
about
this
the
killer
s
family
is
also
not
lying
you
seem
like
an
instigator
who
is
just
making
up
his
own
theories
to
get
people
with
grievances
riled
up
and
on
your
side
i
am
not
making
up
any
theories
i
am
not
saying
my
bet
is
this
or
that
like
you
are
doing
people
who
make
up
their
own
stories
are
always
saying
authorities
are
lying
therefore
they
are
justified
to
put
their
own
theories
center
stage
those
are
literally
all
opinions
you
just
think
they
re
facts
because
you
re
well
not
the
brightest
despite
what
you
seem
to
think
what
a
barely
coherent
response
self
employed
living
with
the
parents
same
thing
no
more
or
less
subjective
than
you
thinking
it
s
not
cringy
the
unibomber
killed
randomly
and
on
a
large
scale
this
kid
killed
1
person
it
was
explicit
and
targeted
i
m
not
saying
that
all
people
who
kill
other
people
are
sane
but
they
re
not
all
crazy
either
it
s
called
nuance
the
world
isn
t
just
good
or
bad
it
s
full
of
shades
of
grey
oh
i
m
sure
you
re
gonna
tell
me
do
you
even
know
what
coherent
means
or
is
that
just
something
you
heard
in
a
soundbite
cause
i
m
guessing
you
haven
t
read
a
newspaper
or
book
for
a
very
long
time
if
you
think
i
m
incoherent
i
m
very
practiced
at
following
a
logically
connected
argument
search

sheetz
stop
at

that
s
not
too
far
off
the
path
dubois
sheetz
https

app
goo
gl
8cd8rz1hxxthqxfd8
is
a
good
stop
for
that
run
in
my
experience
any
sheetz
as
another
commenter
said
well
lit
busy
24
7
and
the
best
bathrooms
for
a
gas
station
safe
travels
through
the
keystone
state
rest
stops
are
just
places
to
stop
and
rest
but
every
exit
will
have
some
kind
of
services
i
80
isn
t
a
toll
road
in
pa
so
you
can
hop
on
hop
off
without
issue
my
wife
likes
to
stop
at
the
cracker
barrel
in
buckhorn
it
s
clean
there
is
gas
at
that
exit
i
m
with
everyone
else
mark
some
sheetz
along
your
route
they
are
usually
the
safest
bet
i
don
t
think
they
have
rutters
along
there
but
it
s
another
good
one
similar
to
the
first
comment
several
central
pa
exits
on
i80
have
nearby
wawa
convenience
stores
they
are
generally
clean
and
well
lit
just
did
this
ride
i
believe
the
cheapest
gas
i
saw
was
at
a
place
called
love
s
huge
billboard
displaying
the
gas
prices
visible
from
the
interstate
they
re
right
at
the
exit
well
lit
they
did
have
a
different
price
for
cash
vs
credit
tho
i
hate
that
if
memory
serves
that
was
around
mile
140
or
so
edit
to
add
there
s
a
wawa
with
reasonable
prices
at
the
mount
pocono
exit
also
very
well
lit
and
well
traveled
hi
ive
made
most
of
that
trip
before
as
a
lot
of
others
have
mention
hit
the
sheetz
ive
always
found
them
to
be
very
clean
and
bright
travel
safely
merry
christmas
happy
hanukkah
sheetz
is
always
going
to
be
your
best
bet
the
coffee
and
food
is
arguably
the
best
you
re
going
to
find
along
the
interstate
and
most
of
them
have
a
seating
area
with
outlets
the
restrooms
are
usually
about
the
cleanest
you
can
hope
for
if
you
need
a
more
substantial
break
bloomsburg
state
college
and
lewisburg
all
have
interesting
walkable
small
town
downtowns
about
5
10
minutes
off
i
80
do
not
stop
in
state
college
if
there
s
a
football
game
going
on
though
traffic
will
be
a
nightmare
any
major
truck
stop
chain
along
the
interstate
will
be
safe
as
well
if
you
re
traveling
during
winter
pay
attention
to
the
weather
forecasts
the
stretch
between
roughly
brookville
and
mackeyville
is
arguably
the
most
scenic
segment
in
pa
but
also
can
get
pretty
bad
when
snow
or
ice
hits
if
you
want
to
be
bold
there
is
a
snappy
s
just
off
the
dubois
exit
poor
man
s
sheetz
avoid
the
rest
stops
imho
some
of
them
get
sketchy
at
night
and
i
m
6
3
man
loves
are
a
good
option
well
lit
and
tend
to
have
clean
bathrooms
my
advice
to
you
is
to
stay
in
your
car
for
30
seconds
and
if
anyone
is
loitering
at
a
gas
station
you
can
make
the
decision
to
drive
away

i
am
not
familiar
with
your
route
so
you
will
have
to
check
your
map
if
you
have
a
smart
phone
you
can
put
nearest
gas
station
into
google
and
you
can
usually
find
a
gas
station
if
you
need
gas
you
can
also
get
off
of
i
80
to
go
to
the
nearest
gas
station
you
can
also
send
your
location
to
people
you
know
to
let
them
know
about
your
latest
whereabouts
and
where
you
are
going
you
can
also
put
an
apple
air
tag
or
the
android
equivalent
in
your
car
so
that
you
or
others
have
some
way
to
look
for
it
if
you
get
lost
you
can
also
take
with
you
an
empty
gas
can
but
traveling
with
gas
can
get
dangerous
i
cannot
be
responsible
for
the
accuracy
of
these
internet
searches
but
there
are
also
searches
you
can
do
for
i
80
in
new
york
as
well
i
also
suggest
that
you
have
someone
at
home
with
internet
access
with
the
ability
to
look
things
up
for
you
so
have
them
leave
the
computer
on
i
suggest
you
take
a
blanket
have
an
electric
air
pump
air
gauge
for
your
tires
etc
you
might
also
want
to
bring
a
power
bank
in
case
your
car
breaks
down
which
would
power
your
cell
phone
make
sure
you
have
snacks
and
stuff
i
suggest
you
do
a
pre
road
check
of
your
car
check
the
tires
check
the
anti
freeze
when
the
car
is
off
and
cold
etc
make
sure
you
have
a
spare
tire

you
can
also
look
at

if
that
is
something
you
would
feel

with
make
sure
you
have
a

and
that
it

where
you
are

almost
every

has

amenities
this

some

country

i
don
t
get
it
have
you
ever
driven
on
an
american
interstate
highway
interstate
exits
with
nearby
gas
stations
come
with
huge
blue
signs
that
say
gas
exit
if
you
see
such
a
sign
and
it
has
a
logo
of
a
gas
station
chain
on
this
huge
blue
board
there
ll
be
a
gas
station
right
off
or
very
near
the
exit
if
you
can
t
see
the
gas
station
directly
from
the
exit
ramp
there
ll
be
a
sign
telling
you
whether
to
turn
right
or
left
and
nobody
is
gonna
be
able
to
tell
you
that
one
gas
station
would
be
less
safe
than
another
yes
crimes
happen

they

also
note

the
actually
call

da
boys
2
5
hours
later
you
ll
hit
exit
277
and
you
can
stop
at
wawa
these
will
be
well
spaced
outnforbgas
and
stretch
your
legs
both
stay
fairly
busy
and
are
certainly
very
safe
bonus
you
getnto
try
each
of
pa
s
best
convenient
stores
wawa
has
way
better
coffee
and
grab
and
go
options
while
sheetz
has
better
fried
food
i
frequently
drive
back
to
philly
from
erie
and
of
the
weather
is
good
our
default
is
i80
most
of
rest
stops
closed
also
if
this
week
storm
coming
through
when
we
travel
to
visit
people
in
pa
we
always
plan
on
stopping
at
sheetz
at
least
2
or
3
times
i
wish
we
had
them
on
the
west
coast
if
you
need
frequent
stops
then
stop
somewhere
near
youngstown
then
dubois
maybe
bloomsburg
they
all
have
sheetz
or
similar
i
ve
done
a
similiar
trip
many
many
of
times
it
s
not
a
bad
drive
my
tips
try
to
make
sure
any
gas
stations
are
directly
off
the
road
middle
of
the
state
can
get
a
little
dragged
out
so
just
check
gps
first
there
is
a
wawa
right
at
the
end
of
80
hazleton
i
think
before
you
take
the
north
east
extension
up
to
nyc
it
s
a
great
place
to
stop
there
s
places
to
stop
in
clarion
dubois
brookville
and
bloomsburg
that
are
well
lit

leaving
your
car
at
mechanics
overnight
4
things
to
know
yes
i
d
scout
out
all
the
sheetz
along
i80
they
tend
to
be
pretty
convenient
with
other
businesses
around
my
partner
and
i
take
i80
a
few
times
a
year
and
we
ve
never
had
any
bad
experiences
cause
we
mainly
stay
to
ourselves
stay
on
the
interstate
because
thats
where
the
rest
stops
will
be
keep
your
keys
in
your
hand
if
you
get
out
and
either
be
inside
the
plaza
or
in
your
car
don
t
fuck
about
outside
the
plaza
if
you
have
to
get
out
to
smoke
stay
by
your
car
if
its
crowded
or
full
of
sketchy
looking
truckers
milling
around
feel
free
to
give
the
cashier
a
fake
name
for
food
orders
if
they
ask
for
one
edit
these
are
field
tested
if
you
get
off
at
dubois
go
left
at
the
light
and
there
is
a
snappys
there
that
is
nice
and
safe
a
little
further
along
clearfield
has
a
lot
right
off
their
exit
it
s
easy
on
and
off
i
drive
80
to
michigan
and
back
from
as
far
east
in
pa
as
you
can
be
so
the
whole
thing
i
do
this
several
times
a
year
all
the
rest
stops
are
vending
machines
and
toilets
only
one
or
two
have
attendants
if
you
are
a
little
nervous
stick
with
stopping
at
sheetz
most
of
the
way
and
then
sheetz
or
wawa
for
the
last
part
the
worst
issue
i
ever
had
was
by
trying
to
be
nice
park
a
spot
away
from
a
guy
with
a
flat
tire
it
was
still
light
out
relatively
busy
i
always
carry
a
tire
pump
his
windows
is
down
i
m
6
7
feet
away
i
ask
if
he
would
like
to
use
my
tire
pump
blank
look
i
step
closer
and
start
to
ask
again
and
realise
this
pos
has
his
wiener
out
and
is
jerking
it
right
outside
the
rest
stop
stairs
a
few
curse
words
come
out
of
my
mouth
and
i
realise
no
one
is
paying
any
attention
not
a
single
trucker
or
any
of
the
many
families
walking
around
gross
guy
peels
out
on
his
flat
and
i
called
the
number
i
found
on
the
wall
inside
and
tried
to
explain
it
to
the
poor
lady
that
answers
their
information
line
i
hope
he
wrecked
so
long
story
longer
you
might
want
to
stick
to
the
convenience
stores
keep
your
phone
on
you
your
head
on
a
swivel
and
don
t
talk
to
strangers
there
are
some
effed
up
people
out
there
one
suggestion
instead
of
taking
80
the
whole
way
drive
south
on
79
until
you
hit
76
76
will
take
you
to
78
and
directly
to
nyc
pros
service
station
plazas
throughout
the
route
well
lit
and
well
attended
without
risking
having
to
leave
the
highway
and
getting
lost
these
plazas
include
food
gas
sometimes
information
kiosks
and
signs
will
tell
you
how
far
until
the
next
one
basically
everything
that
sheetz
has
with
a
wider
selection
and
not
having
to
leave
the
highway
fewer
remote
areas
generally
a
little
bit
warmer
which
can
make
a
huge
difference
between
rain
and
snow
this
time
of
year
cons
will
take
longer
and
a
toll
road
for
me
i
m
a
married
woman
but
do
a
lot
of
solo
travel
the
extra
half
hour
45
mins
of
driving
is
worth
not
having
to
worry
about
getting
lost
off
the
highway
or
being
stranded
in
a
remote
area
in
bad
weather
if
you
don
t
want
to
get
off
the
main
road
to
get
gas
or
food
take
the
pa
turnpike
i
76
and
stick
to
their
rest
stops
otherwise
you
ll
have
to
exit
and
follow
signs
to
gas
stations
fast
food
etc
in
town
they
build
em
near
roads
like
i
80
for
a
reason
you
won
t
have
to
venture
too
far
so
it
s
just
a
matter
of
what
s
more
convenient
to
you
seconding
this
as
a
woman
sheetz
is
well
lit
and
heavily
used
i
completely
forgot
about
sheetz
definitely
will
note
them
down
nah
best

is
rutter
s
thank
you
used
to
pass
through
there
and
sometimes
stop
on
drives
to
and
from
college
there
wasnt
much
there
15
years
ago
but
it
is
town
of
sorts
and
one
of
the
few
notable
ones
for
miles
theres
two
exits
for
it
i
think
too
in
case
you
miss
one
i
think
i
used
to
drive
in
one
and
drive
out
the
other
without
stopping
just
to
see
something
that
stretch
of
i80
is
pretty
boring
and
empty
especially
at
night
deleted
buckhorn
has
panera
walmart
and
sheetz
among
other
stuff
all
good
stops
for
a

trip
wawa
is

isn

currently
in

to
my

https

reports
wawa

thank
you
likewise
to
you
thank
you
these
are
all
super
helpful
there
are
also
companion
signs
with
a
listing
of
restaurants
near
the
exit
that
stretch
of
i80
will
have
the
blue
signs
but
nothing
on
them
or
maybe
just
one
thing
some
parts
of
pa
are
empty
and
isolating
not
as
bad
as
say
idk
west
virginia
but
its
close
not
wrong
they
pronounce
it
the
way
the
man
who
it
was
named
after
pronounced
it
and
it
is
do
boys
not
da
boys
and
there
s
a
capital
b
that
said
it
s
a
crappy
town
of
course
i
m
planning
to
pass
the
time
by
talking
with
friends
on
the
phone
and
such
i
appreciate
it
i
m
sorry
that
happened
to
you
yeah
im
a
college
kid
going
back
home
so
i
ve
heard
many
horror
stories
and
just
want
to
be
safe
i
ll
stick
to
convenience
stores
and
sheetz
for
sure
76
will
not
take
you
to
78
not
directly
at
least
you
ll
need
to
jump
off
onto
81
or
222
or
476
to
connect
up
to
78
i
appreciate
it
yeah
all
the
gps
maps
keep
telling
me
to
take
i
80
but
i
ve
been
trying
to
stay
aware
of
the
weather
i
won
t
be
traveling
till
after
christmas
so
i
appreciate
the
heads
up
i
am
sorry
but
this
is
terrible
advice
76
does
not
take
you
directly
to
78
you
have
to
get
on
81
in
between
and
it
s
so
much
longer
and
the
extra
expense
from
the
tolls
is
not
justified
and
if
you
have
the
app
you
can
get
cheap
hot
dogs
walking
out
with
four
chilidogs
you
just
paid
less
than
90
apiece
for
is
an
excellent
way
to
assert
dominance
no
one
messes
with
a
woman
that
can
confidently
eat
four
cheap
hotdogs
sometimes
i
think
people
let
old
horror
movies
get
to
them
if
you
re
driving
along
an
interstate
route
you
ll
be
hard
pressed
to
find
those
dank
one
pump
gas
stations
close
to
an
exit
sure
the
gas
is
pricer
near
the
exit
but
almost
all
of
them
are
well
lit
clean
and
have
decent
amenities
thirding
this
as
a
woman
i
have
to
travel
to
harrisburg
for
my
job
sometimes
by
myself
from
the
northwest
bit
of
the
state
and
there
are
a
couple
sheetz
that
i
always
stop
at
and
usually
clean
bathrooms
and
they
have
delicious
food
another
vote
from
me
for
sheetz
every
store
is
laid
out
the
same
always
well
lit
and
there
s
enough
people
around
that
if
god
forbid
something
did
happen
i
know
i
d
have
at
least
witnesses
i
traveled
back
and
forth
across
80
for
a
while
in
college
to
visit
my
now
husband
and
always
just
searched
for
sheetz
stops
along
the
way
even
when
i
m
going
out
of
state
i
only
ever
stop
at
sheetz
along
major
highways
if
ya
can
make
it
to
conyngham
that
sheetz
is
close
to
the
highway
and
probably
the
best
of
them
all
i
ve
driven
back
and
forth
across
80
so
many
times
and
that
s
often
a
home
base
for
me
friendly
staff
clean
busy
well
lit
and
in
a
pretty
normal
suburbish
area
thinking
it
s
safer
for
women
outside
cities
is
not
grounded
in
reality
well
there
are
several
locations
along
i80
i
guess
you
d
call
that
north
central
pa
i
was
thinking
about
locations
like
blakeslee
brodheadsville
glad
to
help
enjoy
your
drive
fair
but
the
time
i
mentioned
is
still
accurate
i80
is
very
boring
i
recommend
more
interesting
routes
in
general
if
i
was
traveling
solo
i
d
try
to
avoid
80
in
the
winter
just
because
of
the
remoteness
and
winter
weather
being
a
very
real
thing
especially
in
the
mountains
the
southern
route
will
still
take
you
to
elevation
but
is
generally
less
snowy
we
re
going
to
have
to
fight
about
what
s
really
central
pa
i
m
so
tired
of
eastern
pa
trying
to
be
central
came
here
to
recommend
the
wawa
in
blakeslee
it
s
about
a
mile
and
a
half
north
on
route
115
off
exit
184
it
s
well
lit
has
a
large
parking
lot
and
there
are
always
people
there
at
least
during
the
times
of
day
i
have
been
there
which
admittedly
doesn
t
include
the
middle
of
the
night
there
is
also
an
onvo
gas
station
burger
king
right
off
exit
184
that
is
exceptionally
well
lit
as
in
you
can
probably
see
it
from
space
philly
takes
a
lot
of
shit
but
it
s
really
one
of
america
s
coolest
and
most
historic
cities
it
s
also
got
a
really
underrated
skyline
imho
i
love
this
view
what
street
did
you
take
this
on
mlk
drive
i
love
that
section
where
it
s
closed
off
from
the
cars
such
an
underrated
bike
spot
wow
great
timing
did
you
darken
the
sky
that
is
really
really
nice
mlk
drive
so
sad
it
s
closed
that
used
to
be
my
favorite
short
cut
into
town
go
birds
you
sure
did
jk
this
is
my
favorite
view
of
the
city
esp
in
the
summer
this
is
clean
this
photo
screams
frame
me
amazing
shot
if
you
think
it
s
something
now
you
should
have
seen
it
in
2007
it
was
taken
on
mlk
across
from
boathouse
row
god
usually
takes
care
of
the
darkening
of
the
skies
part
but
i
m
sure
op
did
some
magical
processing
of
their
own
we
see
a
lot
of
good
skyline
shots
but
this
one
is
amazing
uncommon
angle
plus
some
knowhow
any
idea
when
the
bridge
will
be
back
used
to
be
my
commute
i
hate
doing
kelly
drive
and
the
river
trail
mlk
is
so
much
less
crowded
and
you
can
cut
right
back
into
the
art
museum
great
shot
very
cool
i
believe
mid
next
year
don
t
get
too
excited
they
plan
on
closing
the
falls
bridge
for
repair
shortly
after
edit
it
was
surprising
difficult
to
find
an
official
source
on
the
falls
bridge
repair
timeline
the
most
concrete
source
i
could
find
was
an
excerpt
from
bicycle
coalition
s
blog
https
bicyclecoalition
org
update
on
mlk
drive
2
year
closure
due
to
bridge
rehabilitation
puchalsky
said
we
expect
the
bridge
to
reopen
to
all
users
in
the
summer
2025
at
that
time
the
falls
bridge
rehabilitation
project
will
start
and
that
bridge
will
close
to
all
users
for
the
duration
of
construction
we
are
coordinating
the
schedules
for
both
projects
the
actual
jury
trial
is
going
to
be
an
oj
trial
level
circus
isnt
it
just
the
jury
selection
process
is
going
to
be
something
to
behold
trying
to
sort
out
people
who
have
friends
or
family
that
have
had
a
bad
time
with
health
insurance
let
alone
themselves
having
a
bias
against
health
insurance
from
personal
experience
we
should
keep
him
and
charge
him
with
willingly
going
to
altoona
the
guy
who
ratted
him
out
to
the
cops
just
made
a
news
appearance
dude
is
never
living
it
down
now
wasn
t
he
someplace
public
with
multiple
witnesses
on
that
date
and
time
we
all
saw
him
being
innocent
right
jury
nullification
just
sayin
sad
he
got
caught
c
hes
a
good
guy
he
doesnt
deserve
to
be
punished
did
nothing
wrong
not
guilty
not
guilty
lets
make
a
statue
of
him
and
celebrate
his
heroic
actions
you
actually
get
extradited
between
states
not
guilty
free
luigi
a
shame
assuming
this
guy
is
actually
the
shooter
then
he
doesn
t
deserve
this
treatment
i
hope
if
this
dude
goes
to
trial
he
puts
the
system
on
trial
if
they
have
all
the
evidence
they
say
they
do
they
have
him
dead
to
rights
just
put
the
whole
system
on
trial
and
truly
become
the
hero
we
need
is
there
any
kind
of
group
protest
or
rally
being
organized
to
take
place
at
the
courthouse
or
somewhere
i
lived
altoona
in
the
70s
good
times
it
s
gonna
be
a
hot
mess
not
sure
how
familiar
you
are
with
the
us
legal
system
but
this
will
most
likely
be
a
simple
case
and
trail
the
ny
prosecutors
will
find
a
jury
who
will
convict
him
he
will
be
sentenced
to
life
possibly
without
parole
no
he
s
going
to
get
convicted
immediately
after
the
trial
ends
i
ll
be
surprised
if
the
jury
deliberates
for
more
than
an
hour
there
s
no
reasonable
doubt
here
he
killed
the
guy
the
evidence
that
s
already
public
is
overwhelming
they
found
the
murder
weapon
and
a
written
confession
on
him
when
they
arrested
him
maybe
his
lawyer
can
get
him
an
insanity
defense
where
he
s
committed
to
a
mental
institution
but
he
s
not
going
to
be
acquitted
why
do
you
assume
there
will
be
a
trial
or
a
jury
trial
he
was
going
to
kill
the
guy
who
invented
that
pizza
next
i
mean
altoona
also
is
where
they
make
mallo
cups
ever
had
one
of
those
but
dark
chocolate
as
long
as
you
call
him
the
copay
killer
that
might
be
a
crime
what
josh
would
actually
sign
the
death
warrant
for
guess
we
should
all

all

if

probably
needed
more

i
know
at

three
men
who
said
they
were
watching
him
pound
their
wives
that
morning
that
is
the
jury
box
part
of
the
four
boxes
make
it
happen
peeps
boom
not
that
kind
of
hearing
replace
all
the
columbus
statues
pa
has
not
charged
him
with
murder
because
the
murder
did
not
happen
within
the
commonwealth
it
has
no
basis
to
charge
for
murder
in
another
state
not
a
lawyer
though
but
states
started
off
as
near
independent
entities
thus
the
weird
quirks
you
see
unique
the
the
us
guess
we
should
all
be
writing

be

i

it

it

no
he
s
going
to
get
convicted
immediately
after
the
trial
ends
not
by
a
jury
of
his
peers
i
certainly
wouldn
t
vote
to
convict
wait
until
the
damn
trial
my
guy
how
do
we
know
the
nypd
or
someone
else
didn
t
plant
that
stuff
we
gotta
at
least
hear
the
defense
s
case
before
we
assume
he
did
it
or
not
okay
then
put
everyone
who
denied
a
claim
in
jail
too
if
they
died
so
you
have
never
heard
of
jury
nullification
before
that
s
the
outcome
i
m
hoping
for
although
it
s
a
slim
chance
why
would
there
not
be
a
trial
you
can
t
arrest
him
indefinitely
without
a
trial
i
m
guessing
he
will
choose
a
jury
trial
because
he
at
least
has
the
possibility
of
getting
off
i
think
a
judge
will
convict
based
on
the
evidence

still
trying
to
figure
out
what
pizza
you
guys
are
talking
about
xd
r
pizzacrimes
bill
is
a
good
guy
let
him
out
of
this
there
s
a
boyer
candy
outlet
store
where
you
can
get
factory
rejects
and
bulk
stuff
for
cheap
and
straight
from
the
factory
their
dark
chocolate
and
chocolate
covered
pretzels
rods
are
the
adjuster
he
did
a
lot
of
work
in
15
minutes
people
will
talk
about
all
the
work
he
did
in
15
minutes
they
will
say
what
a
great
job
he
did
no
one
has
ever
worked
like
him
i
misread
your
comment
at
first
lol
yeah
probably
make
that
4
i
ll
say
it
at
any
hearing
if
they
ask
did
he
stutter
yeah
i
just
didn
t
know
it
was
actually
considered
extradition
and
needed
a
hearing
instead
of
one
state
just
going
hey
would
you
mind
in
some
paperwork
well
you
won
t
be
on
the
jury
pal
so
sorry
for
your
luck
because
i
m
not
stupid
so
i
m
able
to
understand
the
police
didn
t
just
pluck
a
random
guy
out
of
a
mcdonald
s
in
altoona
pennsylvania
and
try
to
frame
him
for
a
murder
that
a
national
manhunt
was
underway
to
solve
i
think
people
like
you
are
projecting
your
own
insecurities
onto
this
you
want
him
to
be
free
so
you
re
scrambling
for
any
silly
excuse
to
make
it
possible
you
have
zero
evidence
anything
was
planted
but
don
t
let
that
stop
you
sometimes
a
bench
trial
is
more
beneficial
than
a
jury
trial
the
state
may
offer
him
a
deal
he
finds
enticing
and
forgoes
a
trial
both
of
these
are
very
common
jury
trials
are
very
uncommon
in
the
criminal
justice
system
contrary
to
everyone
s
belief
if
ever
there
was
a
jury
who
said
nah
i
see
why
i
ain
t
convicting
this
guy
this
is
it
i
don
t
see
it
happening
sadly
but
i
would
want
to
see
them
get
up
there
show
the
jury
a
frame
by
frame
video
of
his
face
and
have
the
entire
panel
go
nope
doesn
t
look
like
him
to
me
not
guilty

i
like
you

ah
fair
1
i
m
not
your
pal
i
don
t
befriend
bootlickers
2
no
i
will
not
be
but
that
s
the
point
the
jury
selection
process
will
be
a
mess
because
there
will
be
a
lot
of
people
like
me
i
tend
to
ignore
comments
that
use
the
word
pal
or
buddy
i
m
saying
that
i
want
to
see
what
the
case
of
the
defense
is
before
i
form
opinions
innocent
people
have
stood
trial
before
people
have
been
framed
before
what
if
he
has
a
rock
solid
alibi
also
you
don
t
need
evidence
that
you
were
framed
the
defense
doesn
t
need
to
prove
being
framed
they
just
need
to
prove
reasonable
doubt
which
could
be
very
possible
i
m
not
saying
that
i
don
t
think
it
s
probably
him
or
that
he
ll
probably
get
a
guilty
verdict
all
i
m
saying
is
we
should
wait
to
hear
his
case
before
shouting
guilty
you
re
ignoring
the
non
zero
possibility
of
jury
nullification
also
the
way
this
dude
is
fighting
he
s
going
to
trial
i
don
t
think
they
will
offer
him
a
deal
what
does
he
have
to
offer
them
he
worked
alone
they
have
plenty
of
evidence
to
get
a
conviction
i
think
i
suppose
they
could
cut
a
deal
if
they
worry
he
will
get
a
big
time
fancy
schmancy
defense
attorney
which
considering
his
family
seems
plausible
i
guess
we
will
see
i
suspect
he
is
waiting
to
see
too
given
he
asked
if
he
could
take
time
to
respond
to
whether
or
not
he
wants
a
public
defender
gotta
see
if
is
family
is
going
to
help
him
or
leave
him
out
to
dry
jury
trials
are
the
most
common
in
criminal
cases
not
sure
where
you
are
getting
your
info
from
i
was
assuming
he
gets
cia
d
before
he
gets
before
the
jury
if
i
was
on
the
jury
i
would
try
to
let
him
walk
lived
near
there
for
the
last
20
years
and
never
knew
that
oh
no
disgrazia
i
used
to
get
pizza
like
that
in
high
school
here
in
pittsburgh
1970s
eh
i
d
try
it
but
i
ll
eat
anything
lmao
ahh
yes
i
m
a
bootlicker
because
i
don
t
think
the
deranged
millionaire
trust
fund
baby
should
have
blown
a
father
of
two
s
brains
out
i
m
not
your
pal
buddy
yet
here
you
are
replying
i
think
i
m
behind
in
my
news
i
better
go
update
myself
contesting
extradition
is
just
a
time
delay
and
futile
after
he
sits
in
jail
for
many
months
he
will
begin
to
understand
what
he
s
actually
facing
this
isn
t
some
martyr
it
s
someone
who
is
mentally
disturbed
and
in
need
of
major
psychological
assistance
they
might
offer
him
a
deal
because
of
the
expense
and
circus
involved
with
a
jury
trial
try
can
have
a
clear
cut
case
yet
still
want
to
avoid
any
sort
of
trial
my
point
is
that
for
every
100
filed
charges
there
might
be
2
3
that
actually
go
to
trial
of
those
one
might
be
a
bench
trial
jury
trials
are
extremely
rare
so
you
have
zero
facts
know
nothing
about
the
future
evidence
presented
and
are
completely
prejudiced
man
you
sound
like
a
great
juror
i
suppose
you
also
think
that
we
should
have
just
let
osama
walk
around
free
since
he
was
also
a
father
and
husband
then
correct
nice
attempt
at
appeal
to
emotions
i
hate
children
so
that
won
t
work
on
me
but
i
assume
if
he
were
a
working
glass
guy
from
the
steel
mill
that
d
be
a
okay
the
problem
with
your
analogy
is
that
that
father
of
two
killed
a
lot
of
people
every
time
his
company
would
deny
access
to
care
when
you
put
it
that
way
yes
my
buddy
my
buddy
wherever
i
goes
he
goes
all
the
morons
in
this
thread
think
a
jury
is
going
to
sit
through
hours
of
a
trial
where
the
prosecutors
lay
out
very
clearly
that
he
murdered
a
guy
that
he
has
no
defense
for
doing
so
and
they
re
gonna
absorb
all
that
information
and
acquit
him
the
former
and
now
next
president
of
the
united
states
got
convicted
in
a
jury
trial
on
less
evidence
than
they
got
on
this
guy
it
s
incredibly
difficult
to
get
acquitted
when
you
have
no
defense
good
point
it
will
be
a
circus
if
they
go
to
trial
didn
t
claim
i
was
a
good
one
i
m
merely
saying
that
in
my
version
of
justice
he
did
nothing
wrong
he
killed
an
evil
man
we
praise
cops
military
and
the
like
for
killing
evil
men
why
is
this
different
you
may
feel
differently
about
this
but
that
doesn
t
make
either
of
us
wrong
i
don
t
think
a
guy
who
orchestrated
flying
planes
into
skyscrapers
is
morally
equivalent
to
an
insurance
ceo
even
if
the
insurance
industry
is
predatory
what
a
stupid
comparison
how
are
you
an
adult
functioning
in
the
world
luigi
mangione
and
his
family
killed
countless
people
by
hoarding
vast
amounts
of
money
that
s
not
even
considering
the
fact
they
ran
predatory
nursing
homes
why
do
you
hate
children
with
such
vitriol
they
had
mountains
of
evidence
against
donald
trump
all
he
needs
is
one
sympathetic
juror
to
hang
the
jury
i
ll
be
real
the
possibility
that
he
s
convicted
is
very
high
the
evidence
is
pretty
overwhelming
and
the
da
is
going
to
do
everything
possible
to
try
and
weed
out
jurors
who
are
sympathetic
to
him
but
there
are
jurors
that
do
occasionally
slip
through
i
hope
you
are
never
on
a
jury
to
decide
any
person
s
fate
you
re
right
the
insurance
ceo
has
killed
orders
of
magnitudes
more
is
it
because
united
health
and
brian
is
responsible
for
more
deaths
but
in
a
more
correct
manner
you
are
basically
saying
murder
is
ok
as
long
as
it
s
in
a
systematic
format
it
s
the
random
killing
that
is
the
problem
or
will
i
find
you
going
off
about
how
someone
like
the
sackler
family
was
unjustly
persecuted
he
can
t
help
what
family
he
was
born
into
a
ceo
has
sufficient
control
of
a
company
to
engage
in
moral
behavior
and
direction
ethically
heinous
actions
directed
by
the
ceo
display
a
person
who
doesn
t
consider
human
lives
valuable
the
argument
the
defense
will
play
out
is
not
if
he
killed
the
ceo
it
will
be
why
he
killed
him
and
that
s
why
a
single
member
of
the
jury
may
disagree
with
a
guilty
verdict
now
that
i
agree
with
and
if
luigi
had
ended
his
own
life
i
would
have
said
good
why
do
you
care
yeah
they
did
and
he
had
no
defense
what
s
this
shooter
s
defense
going
to
be
yeah
we
ll
see
but
if
the
most
famous
american
in
the
country
can
get
convicted
i
would
not
bet
money
on
this
guy
if
the
facts
are
against
you
they
re
against
you
what
would
his
defense
even
be
even
if
there
s
a
hung
jury
he
ll
just
be
held
until
they
can
take
him
to
trial
again
deleted

says

can
t
tell

instantly
i
know
people
here
were
interested

results
so
here
you
go
wonder
if
had
she
survived
her
injuries
her
health
insurance
would
have

that
s
unbelievably
sad
my
heart
goes

catches
a

of
heat
for
being
dishonest
but
this
time
just
this
one
time
i
wish
they
just
lied
and
said
she
probably
passed
instantly
what
a

nightmare

black
philadelphians
experience
hospitalizations
at
a
rate
nearly
double
that
of
white
philadelphians
im
sorry
how
am
i
supposed
to
digest
this
info
when
i
encounter
every
single
day
all
over
center
city
the
worst
traffic
violations
being
committed
by
african
american
drivers
red
light
running
driving
in
the
bike
lanes
speeding
cutting
center
lanes
to
jump
traffic
jfc
there
is
good
goddamn
reason
that
that
demographic
experiences
more
hospitalizations
and
injuries
do
to
driving
meanwhile
the
law
abiding
drivers
pedestrians
and
cyclists
suffer
immensely
from
serious
lack
of
traffic
enforcement
because
cops
are
afraid
to
pull
people
over
it
s
a
sick
joke
anymore
i
m
not
a
fan
of
how
we
only
have
fixed
red
light
and
speeding
cameras
each
one
brings
compliance
to
exactly
one
small
intersection
strip
i
feel
like
philly
getting
5
20
unmarked
mobile
vans
equipped
with
cameras
inside
that
can
do
the
same
thing
would
bring
way
more
compliance
with
speed
limits
and
red
lights
across
the
city
i
think
you
are
coming
at
this
from
the
wrong
direction
black
and
brown
philadelphians
experience
more
traffic
violence
because
they
live
in
areas
with
higher
speed
roads
and
fewer
traffic
calming
measures
like
broad
street
and
the
roosevelt
boulevard
it
is
not
because
they
are
worse
drivers
which
comes
off
as
prejudice
society
has
been
punching
down
on
black
people
for
decades
a
stop
sign
is
the
least
of
their
worries
i
m
not
i
witness
the
shit
driving
behavior
on
the
regular
traffic
calming
measures
don
t
matter
if
people
are
blowing
stop
lights
what
makes
you
think
a
stop
sign
will
matter
a
speed
cushion
speed
cameras
half
the
plates
are
expired
temp
paper
or
plates
that
probably
don
t
even
belong
on
the
car
cops
need
to
blitz
the
streets
and
start
enforcing
traffic
violations
again
simple
as
that
enforcement
alone
is
not
going
to
prevent
these
traffic
deaths
we
need
safer
infrastructure
to
bring
down
these
numbers
a
pa
attorney
won
t
defend
him
in
ny
unless
he
s
licensed
in
ny
i
wake
up
every
morning
thankful
that
i
didn
t
do
something
the
night
before
that
would
require
a
call
in
to
tom
dickey
this
will
likely
just
be
for
extradition
i
m
a
lawyer
and
have
been
across
dickey
in
court
once
seemed
a
nice
guy
who
knew
the
law
if
you
mean
clean
as
in
not
railroaded
into
being
made
an
example
i
can
get
behind
that
hope
i
only
know
him
by
reputation
and
from
some
cle
conferences
as
i
was
an
active
member
and
officer
of
pacdl
the
guy
s
a
good
defense
attorney
are
you
high
he
admitted
to
killing
him
mr
dickey
needs
to
have
medical
delirium
workup
done
on
luigi
including
an
mr
of
his
brain
asap
this
seems
like
a
remarkably
abrupt
personality
change
why
would
you
want
that
i
d
rather
have
the
ceo
s
widow
case
when
she
sues
him
in
civil
court
her
husband
lost
20
years
of
work
at
10m
per
say
goodbye
to
your
family
luigi
you
re
about
to
be
on
your
own
dickey
is
well
known
in
pa
i
wouldn
t
be
surprised
if
he
is
licensed
in
neighboring
states
he
s
a
very
influential
attorney
here
maybe
she
would
be
licensed
in
ny
what
do
you
think
of
this
case
from
a
lawyers
pov
when
did
he
admit
do
you
really
think
a
jury
of
his
peers
is
gonna
care
this
is
not
delirium
delirium
is
waxing
and
waning
metal
stays
confusing
etc
it
would
be
impossible
for
someone
with
delirium
to
carry
out
a
preplanned
murder
and
disappear
for
several
days
think
of
an
old
person
in
the
hospital
newly
terribly
confused
because
they
are
sick
with
a
urinary
tract
infection
that
s
delirium
because
people
irrationally
think
that
because
they
agree
with
this
specific
person
and
this
specific
victim
it
means
he
did
a
good
thing
and
shouldn
t
be
charged
with
a
crime
or
found
guilty
even
if
it
influences
other
people
to
do
the
same
to
whatever
victim
s
they
d
pick
thinking
it
would
also
be
popular
good
luck
getting
10k
out
of
the
average
american
and
you
re
talking
about
200
million
come
on
man
sue
me
got
200
mil
you
ll
never
see
a
dime
his
firm
s
website
says
dickey
practices
in
over
50
counties
of
pennsylvania
and
in
federal
court
i
d
be
furious
at
the
stupidity
of
my
client
keeping
the
evidence
for
a
week
including
what
s
basically
a
written
confession
and
i
m
sure
he
talked
to
police
without
a
lawyer
present
when
police
have
a
question
shut
the
fuck
up
guy
is
fried
toast
unless
jury
nullifies
you
people
need
to
get
off
reddit
for
a
while
they
only
have
to
pass
judgement
on
the
charge
he
did
it
he
s
guilty
poor
choice
of
words
on
my
part
a
thorough
neuropsych
workup
would
be
more
accurate
i
m
thinking
along
the
lines
of
charles
whitman
the
austin
sniper
his
autopsy
showed
a
thalamic
tumor
he
s
also
at
the
perfect
age
for
developing
schizophrenia
that
s
not
ny
court
he
must
be
admitted
to
the
bar
the
accused
will
need
ny
attorneys
once
he
s
back
in
ny
nal
but
if
anyone
is
would
an
attorney
take
a
high
profile
case
like
this
pro
bono
or
at
some
super
discount
just
for
the
basically
free
advertising
not
sure
how
this
would
work
and
just
curious
when
police
have
a
question
shut
the
fuck
up
doesn
t
matter
how
many
times
you
say
this
people
just
are
never
gonna
take
that
advice
doesn
t
seem
like
he
cared
about
getting
caught
yeah
not
a
lawyer
but
i
m
like
why
if
you
re
just
going
to
go
barnstorming
the
country
with
the
alleged
murder
weapon
and
a
helpfully
analog
copy
of
your
confession
with
your
face
plastered
all
over
the
internet
a
why
flee
the
crime
scene
in
the
first
place
b
why
not
just
turn
yourself
in
doesn
t
make
sense
imo
personally
i
think
he
wanted
to
be
caught
at
the
end
of
the
day
he
wants
martyrdom
serious
question
is
there
a
way
to
put
the
health
insurance
industry
on
trial
here
because
that
s
what
needs
to
happen
here
that
s
what
a
high
profile
lawyer
worth
his
salt
should
to
do
i
know
this
is
gonna
offend
you
but
it
s
not
just
reddit
on
luigi
s
side
jury
nullification
i
can
be
a
juror
and
decide
he
is
guilty
but
advocate
for
no
conviction
just
knowing
what
jury
nullification
is
usually
eliminates
you
from
being
a
juror
yes
he
is
a
national
hero
and
i
m
hardly
on
reddit
but
good
attempt
at
an
insult
while
this
may
be
true
or
not
it
is
very
hard
to
arm
chair
psychiatrist
from
the
info
that
is
publicly
available
i
ll
leave
this
to
his
lawyers
also
a
quick
reminder
that
people
with
schizophrenia
are
not
any
more
dangerous
than
people
without
people
with
schizophrenia
are
much
more
likely
to
be
a
victim
of
violent
crime
than
committing
violent
crime
i
m
not
saying
that
he
has
or
doesn
t
have
it
that
s
not
for
me
to
decide
but
automatically
grasping
at
mental
illness
or
tumors
for
a
cause
of
antisocial
behavior
isn
t
helpful
for
reducing
stigma
of
those
with
mental
illnesses
or
other
medical
conditions
especially
when
publicly
available
information
is
sparse
could
be
permitted
pro
hoc
vice
but
i
doubt
that
would
happen
lol
yes
i
know
people
wondered
if
he
was
which
is
why
i
pasted
the
pertinent
info
from
his
website
showing
that
no
he
doesn
t
seem
to
be
licensed
anywhere
but
pa
of
course
not
the
crazy
ones
never
think
they
did
anything
wrong
look
how
much
the
manhunt
has
been
in
the
news
i
doubt
it
d
be
as
talked
about
right
now
if
he
didn
t
get
away
for
nearly
a
week
personally
i
think
he
wanted
to
be
caught
at
the
end
of
the
day
then
why
d
be
get
caught
at
breakfast
no
it
s
irrelevant
to
the
case
at
hand
and
will
be
excluded
although
any
adverse
treatment
by
the
insurance
company
towards
the
defendant
and
or
his
family
will
almost
certainly
be
admitted
bc
it
goes
to
motive
and
the
prosecution
will
chomp
at
the
bit
to
get
it
in
front
of
the
jury
and
the
thing
is
it
s
not
just
redditors
on
luigi
s
side
except
redditors
are
the
only
social
media
people
trying
so
hard
to
have
high
horses
and
go
murder
is
murder
redditors
need
to
get
outside
they
don
t
understand
the
real
world
as
if
facebook
tiktok
and
twitter
aren
t
also
loving
luigi
hell
my
own
grandma
at
least
liked
that
100k
people
laughed
at
unitedhealthcare
s
rip
brian
post
on
facebook
bruh
this
is
reddit
relax
he
she
has
a
very
good
point
this
being
reddit
doesnt
mean
they
cant
expand
on
the
conversation
yum
the
best
flavor
combo
warwick
is
literally
the
best
icecream
on
the
market
and
it
s
not
even
close
oh
delicious
i
need
more
death
by
chocolate
dayum
where
can
i
get
this
am
i
the
only
one
that
always
thought
warwick
ice
cream
was
crap
it
was
just
this
past
summer
we
had
it
at
2
different
local
shops
and
realized
it
was
actually
pretty
damn
amazing
take
a
quick
drive
into
swansea
and
acquire
the
most
vaunted
ice
cream
in
all
of
massachusetts
warwick
is
imo
the
best
mass
marketed
ri
based
ice
cream
though
what
ice
cream
in
swansea
because
i
live
2
minutes
from
swansea
and
can
t
think
of
a
single
ice
cream
place
there
that
i
want
more
than
warwick
i
would
rather
drive
to
hell
than
mass
probably
the
ice
cream
barn
that
wouldn
t
even
be
my
first
choice
to
go
to
in
swansea
i
also
can
t
stand
the
smell
over
there
enough
to
sit
and
eat
ice
cream
lol
wow
has
it
been
10
years
already
it
s
hard
to
celebrate
when
it
s
become
so
commercialized
so
i
m
gonna
try
and
cause
an
accident
during
rush
hour
tonight
so
everyone
remembers
the
true
meaning
of
the
bridge
closure
people
can
get
out
of
their
cars
and
sing
bridge
closing
carols
and
get
into
the
spirit
of
the
bridge
being
closed
i
was
going
to
make
a
post
about
how
bad
ri
drivers
are
i
m
setting
up
a
tent
chair
and
a
cooler
to
watch
for
the
day
of
reckoning
i
heard
rumors
that
our
vaunted
ri
television
media
will
be
at
the
bridge
tonight
singing
dan
dan
he
s
our
man
if
he
can
t
do
it
no
one
can
i
mean
they
re
effectively
cheerleaders
and
unpaid
pr
interns
for
state
leadership
anyway
so
why
not
right
as
a
resident
living
near
warren
avenue
in
ep
i
d
love
everyone
to
come
over
and
congest
every
road
near
me
to
experience
that
again
the
important
thing
is
to
keep
the
shutdown
with
you
all
through
the
year
cheers
to
all
the
amazing
places
it
put
out
of
business
good
job
ri
at
helping
small
businesses
flourish
tears
in
the
rain
if
it
doesn
t
have
smokey
in
there
waxing
poetic
about
the
ocean
mist
i
don
t
want
it
weird
could
ve
sworn
there
was
already
a
server
what
s
the
point
can
you
post
the
discord
link
itself
i
m
having
an
issue
opening
up
discord
from
the
ios
reddit
app
can
we
share
ri
s
spy
reports
on
ma
ct
on
the
discord
server
removed
im
from
attleboro
can
i
join
that
s
cool
removed
recommendation
as
it
grows
could
add
different
sun
channels
for
different
towns
or
counties
districts
hey
we
also
have
the
reddit
chat
feature
so
you
may
be
thinking
of
that
i
know
some
others
have
posted
discord
links
in
the
past
but
we
aren
t
affiliated
with
any
of
those
servers
because
it
s
the
cool
thing
to
do
seriously
though
discord
lends
itself
to
a
different
style
of
casual
conversation
we
are
still
experimenting
with
the
setup
so
feel
free
to
provide
any
feedback
totally
agree
it
s
weird
to
post
a
link
to
a
discord
server
on
reddit
and
keep
it
as
the
number
one
comment
forever

your
post
was
removed
because
it
doesn
t
allow
for
an
on
going
conversation
of
course
no
this
is
not
considered
appropriate
hah
i
m
sure
i
won
t
have
any
feedback
seems
like
it
s
just
not
for
me
and
that
s
okay
thanks
lesss
fukin
gool
may
i
ask
you
why
thank
you
that
s
why
i
asked
beforehand
this
isn
t
entirely
accurate
as
there
is
a
functioning
nuclear
reactor
on
uri
s
bay
campus
there
s
a
nuclear
powerplant
going
up
in
devens
so
not
sure
how
accurate
this
is
one
of
the
things
holding
back
the
u
s
the
most
is
the
fear
and
legislation
preventing
nuclear
power
from
becoming
the
main
source
of
energy
millstone
is
right
next
door
so
it
s
not
like
there
isn
t
one
nearby
hippies
small
modular
reactors
not
really
it
s
more
due
to
neoliberal
nuclear
panic
in
the
80s
90s
i
nuked
the
bathroom
luigi
s
express
in
johnston
one
time
and
ri
was
anti
nuclear
ever
since
more
likely
because
of
three
mile
island
they
have
a
whole
housing
development
out
there
now
nice
places
deleted
nuclear
power
plants
were
proposed
for
two
locations
in
rhode
island
in
the
early
1970s
rome
point
in
north
kingstown
and
charlestown
i
believe
on
ninigret
pond
the
then
young
save
the
bay
organization
rallied
to
stop
the
rome
point
project
and
claudine
schneider
led
the
effort
to
stop
the
charlestown
project
she
went
on
to
help
found
the
conservation
law
foundation
and
served
a
short
stint
as
a
u
s
congresswoman
from
rhode
island
those
efforts
effectively
killed
the
idea
of
siting
a
nuclear
power
plant
in
rhode
island
like
everything
else
we
can
t
have
in
ri
it
s
because
of
the
nimbys
selfish
fucking
boomers
it
s
because
our
leadership
is
retarded
let
s
ban
a
good
green
energy
source
yet
let
scams
of
solar
and
the
absolute
destruction
of
our
fishing
industry
with
wind
turbines
thrive
under
a
disguise
of
going
green
they
are
all
deplorable
im
down
the
road
from
that
accident
site
ive
yet
to
see
any
three
eyed
fish
or
mutant
coyotes
simpsons
lied
could
be
wrong
but
i
used
to
work
for
a
certain
military
contractor
in
rhode
island
who
leaves
all
their
nuclear
work
for
their
other
building
in
connecticut
it
has
to
do
with
the
population
per
square
mile
in
rhode
island
and
how
in
the
rare
event
of
a
catastrophic
failure
it
would
be
almost
impossible
to
evacuate
the
entire
state
minnesota
has
3
operating
nuclear
power
facilities
this
is
not
accurate
it
s
because
the
us
does
not
have
a
high
level
waste
facility
at
least
i
looked
up
why
oregon
has
it
the
other
day
and
that
was
the
reasoning
nothing
to
do
with
accidents
everything
to
do
with
the
nuclear
waste
no
it
s
because
ri
politicians
are
in
the
pocket
of
national
grid
and
having
a
monopoly
on
power
is
more
important
to
them
than
doing
the
right
thing
maybe
it
s
because
of
this
60
year
anniversary
of
united
nuclear

charlestown

60
year
anniversary

nuclear
accident
in
charlestown
no
it
s
not
it
wasn
t
that
long
ago
that
they
banned
any
and
all
nuclear
power
nuke
subs
can
t
even
port
at
eb
in
quonset
anymore
fukushima
fukushima
fukushima
yes
indeed
very
cool
mostly
a
medical
research
reactor
i
have
stood
over
the
core
on
the
gantry
bridge
to
the
control
platform
at
near
full
power
the
blue
pool
is
wild
absorbed
the
same
amount
of
radiation
as
a
cross
country
flight
in
10
minutes
however
way
up
there
on
my
greatest
things
i
ve
ever
seen
chart
woah
really
i
used
to
work
on
the
bay
campus
but
didn
t
know
that
or
is
it
recent
i
m
guessing
not
since
there
s
a
ban
eta
it
was
there
you
d
think
reactor
road
would
have
been
a
clue
for
me
but
i
guess
i
m
dumb
i
mean
it
is
correct
the
nuclear
reactor
at
uri
is
not
a
power
plant
it
s
purely
a
research
raactor
this
says
nuclear
power
plants
are
banned
not
to
mention
this
is
only
a
ban
on
construction
not
existing
operation
is
it
weird
that
my
first
thought
was
oooh
i
hope
i
m
in
the
blast
radius
there
also
used
to
be
one
near
the
end
of
wickenden
st
in
providence
sorta
behind
the
thrift
and
the
market
it
was
run
by
brown
definitely
some
stuff
for
nuclear
medicine
research
i
know
they
sent
product
to
cornell
for
their
research
i
believe
that
s
a
fusion
reactor
for
research
not
a
fission
reactor
fusion
reactors
don
t
use
radioactive
materials
they
use
a
hydrogen
isotope
there
s
no
risk
of
meltdown
or
radioactive
contamination
and
no
nuclear
waste
this
is
100
true
ri
is
almost
completely
dependent
on
foreign
other
state
s
energy
of
that
energy
production
most
of
it
is
from
natural
gas
which
as
we
know
are
heavy
hitting
lobbyists
current
nuclear
energy
is
extremely
clean
safe
and
efficient
green
energy
seabrook
isn
t
that
far
either
the
damn
environmentalists
back
in
the
day
fought
so
much
against
nuclear
power
and
the
sad
thing
is
it
s
much
better
for
carbon
emissions
than
other
power
sources
never
trust
a
hippy
i
am
assuming
you
guys
are
all
magats
do
tell
me
what
sources
articles
etc
have
convinced
that
nukes
are
a
good
idea
our
state
law
regarding
reactor
development
was
enacted
in
1956
three
mile
island
wasn
t
until
1979
good
deer
hunting
too
oh
no
the
brayton
point
plant
dumped
its
hot
water
in
the
bristol
bay
that
could
also
just
be
a
function
of
their
ct
plan
being
larger
with
a
lot
more
workers
too
it
s
a
ban
on
constructing
new
plants
that
was
passed
30
years
ago
at
that
point
minnesota
already
had
those
nuclear
plants
and
they
re
still
in
operation
ri
politicians
are
in
the
pocket
of
national
grid
why
would
a
corporation
that
doesn
t
even
operate
here
be
buying
off
our
politicians
thats
the
same
one
i
don
t
think
any
modern
sub
can
port
at
quonset
anyway
we
don
t
have
the
depth
for
it
we
don
t
get
earthquakes
bad
enough
for
a
disaster
like
that
nuclear
energy
is
a
clean
efficient
and
reliable
power
source
with
minimal
carbon
emissions
making
it
a
key
tool
in
combating
climate
change
it
generates
massive
amounts
of
energy
from
small
amounts
of
fuel
provides
a
stable
energy
supply
unaffected
by
weather
and
reduces
dependency
on
fossil
fuels
enhancing
energy
security
advancements
in
technology
such
as
safer
reactor
designs
further
enhance
its
potential
while
challenges
like
waste
management
and
public
safety
concerns
exist
with
proper
regulation
and
innovation
nuclear
energy
offers
a
sustainable
and
economically
beneficial
solution
to
global
energy
needs
that
s
awesome
i
m
assuming
you
have
to
be
in
a
relevant
program
to
get
that
tour
i
did
this
on
a
physics
class
trip
in
1992
pretty
crazy
to
let
high
school
students
up
there
different
times
i
guess
well
even
then
it
s
not
accurate
they
re
not
banned
they
just
require
legislative
approval
even
if
it
blew
up
it
s
relatively
low
power
i
think
when
i
went
there
the
attendant
said
it
probably
wouldn
t
even
take
out
the
campus
it
s
been
a
few
years
though
so
i
m
not
sure
oh
wow
thanks
for
sharing
your
knowledge
on
this
super
cool
i
am
pro
nuclear
energy
but
thinking
of
ri
safely
handling
a
reactor
sends
chills
up
my
spine
is
still
neither
abundant
or
cost
effective
enough
to
be
a
full
solution
and
nuclear
energy
is
arguably
green
based
on
the
lack
of
environmental
impact
nope
i
live
right
by
it
i
know
nuclear
power
is
the
only
realistic
way
to
achieve
a
green
future
can
you
imagine
if
we
had
pursued
nuclear
more
boldly
we
could
have
very
well
never
bothered
fracking
a
thing
and
we
would
currently
have
cheap
electricity
with
no
carbon
emissions
and
a
high
tech
industry
around
it
instead
of
what
we
have
now
people
wildly
overestimate
the
risks
of
nuclear
power
and
even
of
nuclear
accidents
a
chernobyl
would
never
happen
with
modern
designs
and
even
fukushima
events
are
designed
out
of
plants
being
built
these
days
and
while
it
s
an
expensive
and
tragic
debacle
at
fukushima
only
a
small
amount
of
land
was
rendered
uninhabitable
imo
we
d
be
well
served
replacing
each
one
of
our
40
year
old
reactors
with
four
or
five
ap1000s
they
d
be
much
cheaper
to
build
if
we
had
a
bunch
of
them
in
the
pipeline
so
developers
could
pipeline
their
construction
when
the
concrete
at
one
is
done
the
concrete
pourers
move
to
site
2
and
the
pipefitters
move
in
and
so
on
nuclear
power
not
nukes
very
different
things
pretty
sure
not
a
single
comment
above
me
is
a
maga
a
lot
of
environmentalists
support
nuclear
power
if
you
want
an
irl
example
of
how
it
can
go
well
you
can
just
look
at
france
a
vast
portion
of
their
electricity
is
generated
by
nuclear
energy
oh
let
me
tell
you
folks
it
s
unbelievable
when
people
mix
up
nuclear
power
and
nuclear
weapons
i
mean
how
do
you
not
get
it
one
is
for
energy
clean
tremendous
energy
the
best
energy
and
the
other
well
it
s
for
blowing
things
up
big
difference
but
some
people
don
t
know
they
don
t
have
a
clue
sad
they
re
probably
the
same
people
who
think
you
can
charge
your
phone
with
a
solar
panel
at
night
just
terrible
understanding
folks
really
bad
i
d
say
it
s
just
the
general
fear
of
the
word
nuclear
in
the
heigh
of
the
cold
war
either
way
a
law
written
70
years
ago
banning
construction
of
a
new
technology
probably
shouldn
t
be
on
the
books
anymore
the
people
who
wrote
and
passed
that
law
are
idiots
and
even
though
we
wouldn
t
be
likely
to
build
a
plant
anytime
soon
the
lawsuits
would
drag
out
forever
we
should
just
repeal
the
law
out
of
spite
with
a
simple
voice
vote
acknowledgement
that
the
people
who
wrote
it
didn
t
know
what
the
fuck
they
were
talking
about
because
it
makes
my
made
up
comment
more
believable
oh
that
s
interesting
so
many
names
for
the
same
place
i
was
doing
some
federal
contract
work
in
conjunction
with
uri
years
ago
i
majored
in
physics
and
got
around
to
talking
at
length
about
the
lhc
in
cern
with
the
chief
engineer
eventually
i
procured
myself
an
estimate
of
the
next
time
the
reactor
would
be
at
full
power
a
glorious
coincidence
happened
that
i
had
to
return
during
that
period
for
a
loose
end
while
my
new
acquaintance
was
operating
the
reactor
personally
i
ll
never
forget
staring
down
into
that
crystal
clear
pool
with
a
blue
hot
reactor
just
20
feet
below
my
feet
with
just
that
depth
of
water
for
protection
there
is
a
tube
out
the
back
of
the
tank
that
makes
a
window
to
the
core
they
put
all
kinds
of
stuff
from
medication
to
pig
meat
in
that
tube
irradiate
it
and
draw
observations
for
experiments
all
over
the
country
probably
helped
that
i
had
and
maintain
a
security
clearance
i
went
there
on
a
high
school
field
trip
i
got
to
take
a
class
there
on
a
field
trip
seeing
the
cherenkov
radiation
from
the
core
was
so
wild
best
part
you
know
what
they
use
to
clean
the
radiation
shield
water
a
robot
pool
skimmer
that
i
didn
t
know
fair
enough
that
s
a
meaningful
difference
in
reality
vs
the
title
well
it
s
near
the
ocean
for
a
good
reason
unlimited
seawater
to
quench
the
core
if
there
was
an
emergency
and
gravity
fed
then
dozens
of
safeguards
beyond
that
i
worked
on
some
and
iirc
everything
was
in
triplicate
on
those
systems
and
controls
everything
i
was
told
the
same
about
the
worst
case
it
is
a
relatively
low
yield
reactor
that
would
by
design
limit
its
damage
to
the
campus
if
the
unthinkable
happens
the
entire
thing
is
completely
contained
within
a
multi
layered
concrete
sarcophogus
that
i
actually
remember
being
very
robust
and
actually
reassuring
then
living
just
a
dozen
or
so
miles
away
downwind
that
is
both
disappointing
and
reassuring
at
the
same
time
how
would
it
blow
up
there
s
basically
nothing
explosive
in
or
near
a
reactor
the
worst
case
scenario
is
a
runaway
reaction
that
leaks
radiation
you
basically
have
a
circle
of
various
levels
of
possible
radiation
exposure
around
the
core
power
plants
of
any
kind
wouldn
t
really
be
run
by
the
state
government
anyway
why
the
guys
who
maintained
the
washington
bridge
are
looking
to
expand
theirs
businesses
set
so
we
already
have
the
talent
in
state
s
hopefully
it
s
obvious
if
you
aren
t
serious
about
nuclear
you
aren
t
serious
about
climate
change
period
i
m
very
pro
nuclear
and
agree
modern
reactors
are
safe
and
a
badly
needed
addition
to
our
energy
strategy
tossing
random
stuff
in
a
reactor
to
see
what
happens
is
an
awesome
use
of
tuition
that
s
so
cool
that
s
a
great
point
i
really
appreciate
the
refreshing
attitude
here
many
people
still
live
in
the
past
yeah
even
the
legit
waste
concerns
aren
t
as
valid
anymore
compared
to
40
50
years
ago
humanity
and
science
are
awesome
at
solving
specific
problems
like
that
larger
ones
like
climate
change
we
re
determined
to
be
the
man
in
the
flood
parable
and
just
rejecting
solutions
either
by
getting
bogged
down
in
the
minutia
of
them
or
just
denying
the
fucking
problem
in
the
first
place
what
a
time
to
be
alive
i
ve
done
some
projects
in
the
reactor
for
radiation
testing
and
i
regret
to
say
you
can
t
just
toss
random
stuff
in
took
months
of
paperwork
to
approve
the
test
materials
along
with
a
few
tens
of
thousands
of
dollars
the
department
of
energy
itself
had
to
approve
the
testing
but
they
are
very
approachable
as
far
as
research
reactors
go
and
relatively
low
cost
since
they
aren
t
high
power
it
was
a
cool
visit
yeah
but
that
s
not
how
it
works
operations
staff
and
experiments
are
paid
for
by
fda
biopharms
other
universities
state
and
federal
grants
hospitals
conducting
studies
aerospace
tests
etc
they
don
t
just
operate
for
free
with
uri
students
running
around
stuffing
samples
in
the
core
like
they
re
working
a
pizza
oven
the
site
is
highly
controlled
and
to
be
honest
i
only
saw
a
couple
of
students
there
in
the
couple
weeks
i
was
involved
i
d
be
surprised
if
any
tuition
supports
it
and
it
s
a
nice
tool
for
uri
it
s
actually
used
like
a
time
machine
the
background
radiation
exposure
anywhere
including
in
space
days
to
decades
can
be
simulated
in
minutes
and
the
samples
come
back
completely
safe
a
variable
power
reactor
has
many
experimental
benefits
over
a
decay
source
and
exposure
time
was
quite
valuable
iirc
department
of
energy
more
like
department
of
no
fun
peter
alviti
the
transportation
director
said
tuesday
i
have
no
evidence
at
this
point
that
points
to
anyone
inside
dot
it
s
interesting
but
hardly
surprising
how
the
bar
for
getting
fired
has
shifted
from
incompetence
to
active
malfeasance
this
reads
like
an
advertisement
to
hook
up
with
a
mature
gentleman
at
osamequin
nature
trails
nothing
new
unfortunately
this
is
an
on
and
off
problem
going
back
at
least
the
20
years
i
ve
been
in
town
i
ve
never
really
understood
what
the
root
cause
is
it
s
not
a
big
place
and
it
s
sort
of
a
pain
to
get
in
and
out
of
if
you
aren
t
local
thanks
for
the
tip
thought
they
busted
some
guys
this
summer
for
that
get
a
room
man
lol
this
is
nothing
new
i
used
to
work
for
the
radio
stations
like
25
years
ago
and
would
go
for
a
walk
there
on
my
lunch
break
one
day
this
old
dude
was
just
walking
around
vigorously
masturbating
i
was
like
what
the
fuck
threatened
to
knock
the
dude
out
and
got
out
of
there
pervert
park
you
gotta
steer
clear
of
that
place
i
ve
heard
the
barrington
police
are
flying
a
drone
over
there
to
catch
frolickers
this
has
been
a
cruising
spot
for
decades
it
s
not
that
large
an
area
so
it
never
made
sense
to
me
the
rumor
at
one
point
was
which
direction
your
car
pointed
was
a
signal
of
what
you
were
looking
for
like
lincoln
woods
come
as
strangers
leave
as
friends
are
you
internet
explorer
because
that
s
some
old
news
whatever
you
do
don
t
google
what
goes
on
at
rest
areas
have
you
tried
telling
them
that
what
they
re
doing
feels
kind

i
will

no
the

frequent
the

with

you
scare
them
off
goddamn
do
i
hate
being
expected
to
yield
while
correct
a
great
place
to
come
together
lol
that
tiny
little
park
in
pawtuxet
is
one
too
apparently
you
don
t
need
a
very
big
park
for
cruising
lincoln
woods
really
where
and
no
i
m
not
looking
to
hookup
i
m
generally
curious
moved
here
recently
so
i
personally
appreciate
the
info
will
avoid
the
place
hopefully
the
police
can
get
it
under
control
found
the
pervert
who
walks
around
the
woods
trying
to
hook
up
with
unsuspecting
strangers
not
cool
exposing
a
pervert
who
frequents
a
tiny
public
park
in
barrington
you
re
either
that
person
or
support
what
theyre
doing

if
you

it

the
state
is
in
a
housing
crisis
not
just
an
affordable
housing
income
restricted
usually
subsidized
crisis
k
housing
should
cost
one
week
s
pay
the
systematic
disinvestment
in
public
housing
has
in
large
part
caused
the
negative
reality
we
see
today
unless
of
course
one
believes
the
type
of
residents
served
causes
the
issues

we
deserve
have
place
live
how
us
underfunding
public
housing
harms
rights
new
we
broke
this
on
purpose
now
it
doesn
t
work
which
means
it
was
never
going
to
work
more
bullshit
in
boston
housing
is
so
expensive
that
individuals
making
over
90
000
a
year
qualify
for
section
8
housing
and
the
wait
list
is
20
years
long
if
rhode
island
doesn
t
take
steps
to
tackle
housing
affordability
immediately
we
are
going
to
find
ourselves
in
the
exact
same
situation
hard
working
people
making
decent
wages
who
can
t
afford
housing
and
no
resources
to
help
them
would
that
be
bad
i
am
not
sure
you
have
none
of
those
things
increase
the
stock
of
the
types
of
housing
we
need
yeah
agree
it
s
just
a
zoning
issue
nothing
is
allowed
so
nothing
gets
built
then
people
scratch
their
heads
why
there
s
no
housing
that
seems
fine
however
public
money
is
being
allocated
to
this
now
so
what
about
that
500
rent
would
be
absolutely
fucking
awesome
the
problem
we
have
is
a
housing
shortage
not
a
public
housing
shortage
there
isn
t
a
shortage
of
developers
willing
to
build
just
a
shortage
of
politicians
willing
to
ignore
the
nimby
crowd
when
did
it
ever
work
from
day
one
the
only
success
story
in
public
housing
has
been
concentrating
poverty
at
the
expense
of
the
people
it
was
trying
to
help
i
grew
up
with
friends
in
public
housing
they
were
effectively
trapped
interesting
as
a
former
landlord
i
can
tell
you
that
often
section
8
brought
problematic
tenants
one
person
s
apartment
was
raided
by
police
for
drugs
another
had
an
aci
ankle
cuff
who
violated
his
parole
and
was
brought
back
to
prison
mid
month
another
was
letting
his
kid
urinate
at
will
anywhere
in
the
yard
he
pleased
i
had
to
visit
every
2
weeks
and
clean
the
junk
they
would
leave
in
the
back
even
though
it
was
guaranteed
rent
i
stopped
accepting
section
8
tenants
increase
supply
reduce
demand
out
of
state
assholes
and
zillow
buying
homes
as
investment
properties
will
stop
this
slide
into
oblivion
it
will
probably
be
spent
irresponsibly
inefficiently
because
the
government
is
truly
very
bad
at
executing
these
kinds
of
projects
the
dollars
that
are
poorly
invested
in
these
projects
will
never
substantially
return
so
the
investment
will
not
perpetuate
the
creation
of
units
beyond
the
initial
project
scope
it
s
essentially
eating
the
seed
corn
also
many
of
these
development
projects
will
inevitably
require
zoning
relief
anyways
so
why
not
make
the
zoning
allowances
more
broadly
so
that
private
citizens
can
participate
in
development
too
this
is
an
all
hands
on
deck
matter
for
our
community
edit
to
be
clear
i
supported
the
bond
measure
and
am
not
opposed
to
government
development
in
the
broad
sense
i
m
simply
acknowledging
that
there
are
prohibitive
flaws
in
our
zoning
regs
that
keep
the
citizenry
from
solving
their
own
problems
one
of
the
problems
is
that
developers
aren
t
going
to
build
against
their
own
self
interest
that
means
they
are
never
going
to
build
enough
to
lower
prices
only
just
as
much
as
they
need
to
maximize
the
money
they
make
increase
supply
none
of
the
things
you
listed
increase
supply
they
re
also
going
to
do
all
they
can
to
maximize
profit
which
means
selling
renting
for
as
much
as
the
market
will
allow
a
public
developer
can
rent
at
rates
to
allow
a
reasonable
rate
of
return
i
understand
why
people
do
this
and
perhaps
they
are
a
good
reminder
for
people
to
drive
more
carefully
or
don
t
drink
and
drive
but
i
told
my
wife
if
i
ever
die
in
a
car
accident
please
don
t
do
this
as
i
don
t
want
to
be
remembered
or
memorialized
at
the
place
i
died
i
would
rather
it
be
somewhere
that
i
lived
super
weird
i
passed
by
the
other
day
and
noticed
the
memorial
had
expanded
and
had
to
wonder
how
much
additional
risk
they
re
taking
to
put
some
plastic
shit
out
there
i
don
t
find
the
memorials
themselves
terribly
distracting
although
they
are
universally
ugly
within
30
seconds
of
being
placed
and
are
effectively
organized
litter
within
a
day
that
said
no
one
should
be
stopping
on
a
highway
for
any
non
urgent
reason
that
is
incredibly
dangerous
to
both
the
memorial
builders
and
other
drivers
does
this
include
the
ridiculously
oversized
teddy
bear
that
was
on
the
side
of
95
south
in
pawtucket
for
like
3
years
we
were
in
montana
last
year
and
i
noticed
they
used
small
white
crosses
on
the
side
of
the
road
but
none
of
the
gaudy
accoutrements
less
distracting
and
more
sobering
yes
it
s
going
to
take
another
person
dying
at
the
same
spot
to
force
action
people
are
going
to
lose
their
minds
if
ri
tries
to
stop
the
memorials
and
it
will
take
something
horrific
to
counter
that
you
can
t
even
repave
roads
without
people
getting
pissed
off
you
ll
probably
get
downvoted
to
hell
and
me
too
but
ita
to
me
it
s
such
an
odd
choice
that
spot
has
nothing
to
do
with
your
memories
of
that
person
or
a
place
that
meant
a
lot
to
them
it
has
such
a
pharisee
air
of
everyone
look
at
us
publicly
grieving
eventually
they
start
to
look
like
roadside
trash
the
stupidest
was
one
time
in
west
warwick
a
teenager
died
and
his
friends
set
up
vigil
playing
guitar
and
singing
by
the
curb
after
dark
until
one
was
hit
and
i
think
killed
by
another
car
i
shit
you
not
christians
are
really
bad
drivers
comedians
recycling
jokes
how
about
when
it
s
accompanied
by
a
bottle
of
their
favorite
booze
yikes
does
anyone
here
live
in
a
reality
where
that
seems
like
a
completely
normal
thing
curious
to
hear
the
train
of
thought
i
like
when
degenerates
leave
empty
liquor
bottles
at
the
pole
that
the
drunk
driver
drove
into
the
providence
police
and
ri
state
regularly
request
for
these
to
be
disposed
of
by
the
parks
department
and
ri
dmv
i
ve
seen
them
in
the
red
truck
taking
them
down
i
remember
a
few
years
ago
there
was
a
tv
ad
of
them
saying
not
to
do
this
it
definitely
is
discouraged
but
i
believe
they
have
an
unwritten
rule
to
leave
them
alone
for
a
little
while
there
s
one
on
the
douglas
ave
and
orms
street
split
in
providence
it
is
maintained
by
a
local
gang
a
group
of
gang
members
had
been
chasing
each
other
in
2
cars
from
friendship
street
to
there
while
exchanging
fire
one
of
the
shooters
was
an
18
year
old
gang
member
he
was
killed
there
providence
parks
department
remove
the
candles
they
place
but
leave
the
cabinet
the
gang
members
return
every
year
on
the
anniversary
of
the
kids
death
and
put
up
new
ones
i
think
providence
police
has
another
unwritten
agreement
with
the
gangs
to
leave
the
cabinet
in
exchange
for
a
end
of
hostilities
i
ve
always
wondered
how
the
homemowner
feels
about
the
one
on
central
avenue
in
pawtucket
a
little
east
off
the
exit
before
the
clocktower
factory
on
the
right
there
was
a
motorcycle
accident
there
like
four
years
ago
and
the
memorial
has
pictures
candles
flowers
a
giant
sign
and
a
portrait
on
the
tree
and
it
s
still
growing
i
totally
understand
to
let
people
grieve
but
when
do
you
get
your
tree
and
forty
square
feet
back
tough
situation
most
people
probably
don
t
want
to
chance
retribution
if
they
take
it
down
or
say
anything
then
there
s
those
that
would
guilt
themselves
to
death
over
it
or
never
have
the
courage
to
approach
the
keepers
i
just
can
t
imagine
a
scenario
where
i
would
be
like
okay
this
terrible
thing
happened
on
your
private
property
and
now
i
m
building
a
shrine
here
deal
with
it
i
actually
knew
the
victim
and
the
persons
whom
maintain
it
are
property
owners
themselves
nearby
imagine
going
to
your
neighbors
and
just
building
stuff
on
their
curb
bizarre
weird
that
this
was
posted
today
because
i
had
this
thought
driving
by
a
couple
of
them
within
a
half
mile
of
each
other
on
95
n
this
morning
remembered
in
death
rather
than
in
life
dedicate
a
park
bench
plant
a
tree
in
their
honor
do
something
positive
create
positivity
from
their
memory
plus
they
re
extremely
distracting
i
d
rather
the
families
put
more
work
into
implementing
safer
driving
situations
like
inputting
more
stop
signs
crosswalks
and
speed
bumps
i
will
say
though
i
think
ghost
bikes
https
en
wikipedia
org
wiki
ghost
bike
are
a
necessary
warning
to
all
drivers
they
depict
a
straight
forward
message
rather
than
a
questionable
messy
vigil
whenever
i
see
a
ghost
bike
there
was
one
on
rt
1
near
mtk
my
first
thought
is
this
is
a
common
bike
route
that
has
been
proven
to
be
deadly
for
bikers
so
i
need
to
be
more
vigilant
as
a
driver
roadside
memorials
in
my
opinion
make
more
roadside
memorials
by
distracting
people
i
m
sorry
if
that
s
callous
as
someone
lost
a
loved
one
there
but
paying
attention
to
the
road
is
paramount
i
agree
it
s
annoying
and
distracting
good
thing
you
don
t
live
in
az
those
memorials
are
huge
and
very
distracting
i
always
think
that
the
money
used
on
these
memorials
could
be
used
so
much
better
somewhere
else
if
you
want
to
put
a
simple
marker
reminding
people
someone
died
there
and
to
drive
carefully
it
s
one
thing
but
at
the
price
of
stuffed
animals
and
other
items
why
not
put
the
money
to
good
use
give
it
to
mothers
against
drunk
drivers
or
a
charity
the
deceased
person
was
fond
of
or
if
a
child
a
donation
to
a
children
s
charity
rather
than
leaving
a
rotting
80
stuffed
animal
on
the
road
i
have
often
felt
they
are
a
big
distraction
this
is
what
cemetery
s
and
grave
stones
are
for
not
the
side
of
the
road
2
years
ago
one
of
those
kids
at
that
memorial
pulled
out
real
slow
in
front
of
me
i
really
had
to
swerve
right
to
miss
her
seriously
almost
had
a
new
opportunity
to
put
a
couple
more
at
the
end
of
rt
4
i
actually
do
drive
more
cautiously
when
i
see
them
and
it
let
s
me
know
the
area
may
be
extra
dangerous
bad
curves
blind
spots
etc
for
the
next
time
i
may
drive
through
i
am
distracted
by
even
just
a
pretty
sky
so
i
can
t
see
the
memorials
as
being
more
of
a
distraction
than
literally
anything
else
outside
the
window
the
graveyards
part
had
me
laughing
yeah
it
s
a
bad
idea
agree
100
public
spaces
should
not
be
used
for
memorials
by
private
individuals
there
s
a
large
metal
one
near
the
stop
and
shop
in
north
kingstown
that
will
absolutely
kill
someone
if
they
crash
in
the
same
spot
this
stuff
is
idiotic
counterpoint
pay
attention
to
what
you
are
doing
and
where
you
are
going
and
you
won
t
be
in
any
danger
from
memorials
or
anything
else
on
the
side
of
the
road
the
roads
are
dangerous
especially
if
you
re
distracted
by
every
shiny
thing
you
see
maybe
you
need
to
explore
public
transit
options
some
of
them
aren
t
hurting
anyone
or
causing
any
distraction
and
are
good
reminders
for
people
i
know
of
one
olivia
on
95
south
she
was
in
high
school
and
my
fiance
was
friends
with
her
family
poor
kid
was
killed
by
a
drunk
driver
it
s
just
a
wooden
cross
with
her
name
and
i
think
it
deserves
to
stay
but
your
point
about
that
memorial
at
the
95
n
rt
4
merge
is
totally
valid
and
that
was
incredibly
dangerous
of
them
and
those
gross
teddy
bears
yeah
that
s
not
a
good
way
to
honor
someone
s
memory
this
type
of
shit
cracks
me
up
you
don
t
have
anything
more
pressing
in
your
life
than
to
complain
about
people
memorializing
a
loved
one
in
a
public
area
get
a
hobby
if
a
roadside
memorial
distracts
you
while
driving
maybe
you
should
reconsider
your
ability
to
safely
operate
a
motor
vehicle
i
wonder
how
this
guy
feels
about
cemeteries
well
that
is
certainly
a
hot
take
let
people
grieve
if
billboards
are
okay
there
s
no
way
you
re
going
to
convince
me
a
cross
on
the
side
of
the
road
is
distracting
at
least
we
agree
the
worst
part
is
that
these
things
are
everywhere
maybe
lets
be
safer
drivers
and
push
for
better
road
designs
and
good
alternatives
so
people
aren
t
dying
all
the
time
just
trying
to
get
around
the
state
the
solution
for
less
roadside
memorials
is
less
roadside
deaths
if
anything
i
wish
they
were
more
noticeable
maybe
it
would
do
some
good
if
people
were
more
aware
of
the
deadly
consequences
of
reckless
driving
as
opposed
to
accepting
that
dying
on
our
roads
is
so
common
that
it
s
not
worth
even
acknowledging
jesus
this
sub
doesn
t
like
fucking
anything
does
it
absolutely
fucking
insufferable
the
lot
of
you
you
are
acting
like
a
teddy
bear
on
the
side
of
the
road
is
so
distracting
do
you
all
look
at
the
billboards
also
how
about
just
focus
on
the
road
and
what
s
in
front
of
you
you
people
that
are
distracted
by
the
teddy
bear
are
the
same
ones
that
slow
down
to
20
miles
an
hour
because
someone
has
pulled
over
on
the
side
of
the
highway
focus
accidents
have
got
to
go
they
are
really
dangerous
when
a
car
is
wrecked
and
blocking
a
lane
or
more
and
it
s
really
distracting
not
to
mention
the
gaudy
lights
on
the
police
car
especially
at
night
time
y
all
are
missing
my
point
they
were
parked
and
mingling
in
the
middle
median
and
when
they
re
done
with
their
decorating
they
re
going
to
have
to
merge
into
the
passing
lane
on
a
curve
to
a
major
highway
these
people
are
out
here
being
dangerous
and
to
answer
the
question
about
memorials
vs
billboards
simple
billboards
aren
t
on
state
property
are
billboards
distracting
fuck
yeah
but
they
re
on
private
property
and
maintained
away
from
traffic
i
would
be
saying
the
same
thing
if
there
was
a
billboard
in
the
same
spot
as
that
memorial
on
route
4
i
don
t
think
we
should
judge
in
how
memorials
look
it
s
their
way
to
grieve
and
we
shouldn
t
demonize
all
roadside
memorials
as
long
as
people
set
them
up
safely
idc
at
all
if
i
see
one
man
yall
haters
are
up
complaining
about
shit
already
just
let
people
greave
man
highway
helen
over
here
screaming
into
the
wind
about
memorials
it
certainly
got
your
attention
the
value
of
human
life
is
less
than
zero
in
this
country
smh
i
am
afraid
you
might
be
part
of
the
problem
if
the
presence
of
a
cross
and
some
decorations
on
the
side
of
the
road
are
distracting
enough
to
make
you
crash
this
should
be
illegal
i
don
t
know
why
anyone
would
even
want
to
do
this
you
can
t
camp
there
how
is
it
legal
to
set
up
a
shrine
back
in
the
good
old
days
we
would
ve
constructed
a
megalith
bring
back
megalithic
structures
make
the
people
construct
them
without
modern
tools
if
there
s
one
state
in
this
country
that
should
be
cursed
with
constant
reminders
of
how
bad
the
drivers
are
it
should
be
ri
keep
the
memorials
up
and
let
the
people
witness
how
much
their
roads
resemble
an
actual
graveyard
because
it
s
true
i
ve
always
said
there
should
be
a
way
for
people
to
go
online
and
request
a
memorial
at
a
specific
site
and
have
a
uniform
marker
that
goes
there
with
the
persons
name
on
it
the
ln
have

whoever
install
them

angry
man
shakes
fist
at
clouds
just
going
to
critique
your
support
for
your
argument
here
they
re
not
any
more
distracting
than
a
plastic
bag
blowing
in
the
wind
or
any
other
bit
of
roadside
litter
that
said
having
people
stop
in
a
place
where
stopping
is
only
legal
for
emergencies
for
the
sake
of
decorating
or
otherwise
maintaining
the
memorial
that
s
a
problem
and
a
safety
issue
it
s
sort
of
like
when
you
see
an
animal
become
a
roadkill
because
it
was
trying
to
scavenge
an
existing
roadkill
is
ri
your
homestate
i
have
a
better
idea
people
need
to
stop
dying
on
our
highways
so
many
ways
to
accomplish
this
but
no
one
willing
to
take
the
steps
bad
take
jim
let
people
grieve
ghoul
i
do
believe
in
the
idea
of
not
putting
too
much
stuff
out
for
the
prevention
of
litter
weather
destroying
it
and
spreading
stuff
everywhere
but
people
should
be
able
grieve
at
least
a
marker
cross
and
picture
should
be
just
fine
and
if
something
like
that
is
so
distracting
you
shouldn
t
be
driving
lol
but
i
remember
seeing
those
same
people
at
the
memorial
you
re
talking
about
they
were
parked
far
up
on
the
grass
not
even
close
to
the
road
and
as
for
getting
back
on
the
highway
it
s
just
the
same
as
trying
to
get
out
the
breakdown
lane
just
wait
for
an
opening
i
appreciate
the
memorials
really
goes
to
show
how
many
lives
get
lost
on
the
road
and
it
s
not
just
another
marker
on
the
side
of
the
road
these
are
people
who
lives
were
lost
and
family
members
no
longer
have
them
and
people
grieve
for
them
exactly
plus
it
basically
creates
litter
when
the
stuff
that
s
there
breaks
down
i
will
remember
you
by
logging
into
your
pornhub
account
and
watching
your
recommended
tab
just
remember
the
expression
if
you
want
to
understand
a
person
wank
a
mile
in
their
shoes
yeah
the
main
thing
i
hate
about
these
is
that
it
shows
people
the
exact
spot
the
person
died
why
would
anyone
want
to
think
about
that
all
the
time
celebrate
the
life
lived
not
the
place
it
ended
that
s
where
the
real
memories
thrive
or
the
dead
dear
on
295
that
had
bloated
burst
and
rotted
to
the
point
of
the
torn
hide
hanging
off
the
ribs
shoulders
hips
and
spine
yes
this
is
done
by
the
state
not
by
individuals
specifically
to
show
people
they
need
to
drive
safely
certain
stretches
of
road
there
you
will
see
multiples
especially
on
blind
corner
two
lane
highways
i
think
something
simple
and
biodegradable
is
a
little
better
or
maybe
like
a
tree
if
it
s
not
too
close
to
the
road
as
long
as
we
are
talking
about
this
can
someone
tell
us
about
the
individual
that
lost
their
life
there
deleted
what
does
that
have
to
do
with
recycling
i
m
honestly
more
surprised
that
the
full
bottles
of
booze
actually
end
up
being
staying
there
for
a
while
i
d
have
thought
that
they
d
get
taken
almost
immediately
by
an
alcoholic
who
was
broke
or
some
teens
looking
to
party
for
free
now
i
m
imagining
a
teddy
bear
with
a
heart
that
says
you
re
next
but
it
s
so
small
you
have
to
squint
so
then
you
re
distracted
why
would
a
roadside
memorial
be
more
distracting
than
any
of
the
other
things
that
we
have
along
the
road
like
signs
decorations
outside
of
houses
pretty
trees
people
wearing
funny
hats
is
your
opinion
here
based
on
anything
factual
i
could
easily
argue
that
memorials
also
warn
people
that
certain
stretches
of
road
are
more
dangerous
see
this
is
what
i
m
talking
about
the
highway
isn
t
made
for
this
type
of
shit
the
rules
are
pretty
clear
that
you
don
t
park
in
the
left
side
unless
for
extreme
emergencies
someone
is
going
to
get
killed
because
of
this
shit
yeah
i
hate
those
memorials
so
much
that
i
am
very
careful
to
not
manslaughter
anyone
when
i
drive
dude
it
literally
has
glowing
lights
in
it
if
you
re
driving
your
head
should
be
on
a
swivel
and
lights
at
night
is
something
you
have
to
look
at
it
would
be
insane
not
to
respectfully
what
if
another
driver
is
distracted
by
the
memorial
and
plows
into
me
and
where
does
it
end
do
we
allow
them
to
keep
accumulating
until
there
s
one
every
mile
or
closer
then
they
get
bigger
and
bigger
they
ve
got
to
go
or
at
least
be
replaced
by
a
simple
marker
as
another
person
suggested
i
d
add
that
said
discreet
marker
should
be
taken
down
after
a
year
or
so
til
that
people
get
mad
about
roadside
memorials
right
op
should
go
touch
grass
i
m
blocking
them
now
my
feed
will
immediately
get
100
better
do
you
really
think
a
roadside
memorial
is
going
to
stop
reckless
drivers
they
re
reckless
they
don
t
give
a
shit
about
anything
and
no
amount
of
roadside
decorating
is
going
to
stop
them
from
being
reckless
just
don
t
like
people
dumping
trash
on
the
side
of
the
highway
tbh
were
they
stopped
in
a
place
where
stopping
parking
is
restricted
maybe
that
s
what
you
should
focus
on
that
s
the
point
they
re
not
setting
them
up
carefully
4
5
people
milling
around
on
a
center
median
of
a
major
highway
is
not
safe
how
about
when
the
car
that
is
coming
from
the
center
median
decorating
party
is
crossing
over
slowly
trying
to
merge
from
the
left
on
a
curve
where
people
go
65
that
s
not
a
possible
crash
they
have
those
already
they
re
called
cemeteries
you
can
buy
a
plot
and
put
up
all
the
markers
you
want
the
last
thing
taxpayers
in
ri
need
is
funding
a
highway
memorial
department
yeah
that
s
the
only
one
i
could
find
too
doesn
t
exactly
support
the
seeing
the
memorial
makes
me
drive
safer
cause
it
s
a
dangerous
part
of
the
road
every
part
of
the
road
is
dangerous
when
you
re
being
chauffeured
by
a
shitfaced
friend
it
s
not
about
the
grieving
it
s
about
them
setting
them
up
in
a
place
that
they
shouldn
t
be
it
s
dangerous
i
think
this
is
what
irritates
me
the
most
after
a
while
they
just
look
like
shit
and
create
more
roadside
trash
in
fact
a
couple
weeks
ago
i
stopped
at
one
of
the
ones
on
wellington
avenue
in
cranston
to
pull
some
deflated
mylar
balloons
out
of
the
brush
because
they
were
making
their
way
into
the
pawtuxet
river
like
it
doesn
t
already
have
enough
trash
in
it
i
think
they
should
make
a
law
where
you
can
keep
it
for
one
year
after
that
it
all
has
to
go
the
stat
is
putting
up
crosses
do
they
first
confirm
that
the
person
killed
was
christian
i
believe
that
the
punchline
is
directed
at
the
crosses
and
candles
usually
having
christian
prophets
characters
on
them
as
opposed
to
seeing
a
star
of
david
or
a
buddha
or
whatever
idk
if
this
is
the
accident
but
it
s
the
most
recent
fatal
crash
i
can
find
reports
on
at
that
spot
on
95n

i
ve
heard
the
joke
from
multiple
comedians
so
many
that
i
can
t
tell
you
which
one
said
it
last
but
i
do
know
more
than
one
have
told
it
dw
i
understood
your
joke
dinkleberg
feed
me
my
blood
sacrifice
decorations
outside
of
houses
pretty
trees
people
wearing
funny
hats
you
don
t
see
that
on
the
highway
edit
plus
we
have
cemeteries
and
graveyards
for
a
reason
they
all
annoy
me
there
s
a
guy
in
pawtucket
that
has
a
trashy
memorial
in
front
of
his
house
i
can
tell
he
hates
it
i
drive
by
it
every
day
i
see
him
looking
at
it
with
distain
sometimes
in
the
summer
lights
is
too
far
i
agree
how
does
someone
even
maintain
the
electricity
for
that
are
they
solar
powered
i
think
roadside
memorials
are
fine
but
yeah
they
shouldn
t
be
lit
up
it
will
begin
to
end
when
enough
people
wake
up
and
realize
we
are
not
ever
going
to
fix
driving
to
not
inflict
routine
harm
to
millions
of
people
and
everything
else
on
earth
it
will
begin
to
end
when
enough
people
stuck
with
no
alternative
to
driving
at
least
stop
trying
to
impede
alternatives
to
driving
do
we
let
them
keep
accumulating
until
there
s
one
every
mile
no
there
are
a
lot
of
things
that
can
be
done
to
make
cars
and
driving
safer
we
should
work
towards
there
being
no
need
for
roadside
memorials
maybe
look
into
those
transit
options
i
mentioned
there
s
far
less
risk
of
being
rear
ended
by
distracted
drivers
riding
a
bus
or
a
train
and
even
better
there
s
no
risk
at
all
looking
at
your
phone
when
you
re
a
passenger
on
a
transit
vehicle
people
hate
being
reminded
that
driving
is
the
most
dangerous
thing
they
do
every
day
it
makes
it
harder
for
them
to
just
do
it
every
day
in
spite
of
its
obvious
insanity
usually
i
see
roadside
memorials
on
the
side
of
the
road
like
off
to
the
grass
against
a
tree
usually
at
places
where
there
s
a
breakdown
lane
i
ve
been
driving
for
ten
years
and
the
number
of
times
i
ve
run
into
a
risky
situation
having
to
do
with
a
roadside
memorial
or
active
construction
of
a
roadside
memorial
is
exactly
zero
it
seems
like
a
bit
of
a
logical
leap
to
me
to
go
from
the
people
building
this
memorial
are
being
careless
in
this
one
instance
to
all
roadside
memorials
are
bad
and
inherently
dangerous
those
memorials
exist
to
remind
people
to
go
slower
and
be
more
careful
it
s
impossible
to
quantify
but
i
honestly
would
bet
that
they
have
a
net
positive
effect
on
road
safety
moreover
i
think
you
should
redirect
your
anger
from
the
people
putting
up
memorials
and
instead
maybe
criticize
the
systems
that
result
in
these
deaths
happening
in
the
first
place
america
has
highway
sickness
and
if
you
want
fewer
road
memorials
then
that
means
investing
in
alternative
forms
of
transportation
you
said
that
stuff
is
distracting
during
the
day
and
at
night
all
those
light
are
even
more
distracting
if
those
things
are
so
distracting
to
you
that
it
makes
you
an
unsafe
driver
that
is
a
you
problem
who
pissed
in
your
cornflakes
there
s
no
need
to
be
so
aggressive
i
m
familiar
with
cemeteries
they
can
be
quite
expensive
no
one
said
the
person
requesting
the
simple
roadside
memorial
wouldn
t
pay
to
do
so
just
an
idea
no
you
didn
t
who
is
going
to
clean
it
up
the
dot
they
can
t
even
clean
the
crab
that
s
on
the
roads
nevermind
the
shoulder
hence
the
filth
on
95
and
195
not
to
mention
the
storm
drains
that
are
packed
with
sand
and
they
wonder
why
the
infrastructure
here
is
in
constant
need
of
repair
or
replacement
they
are
noted
as
fatality
markers
by
the
american
legion
which
is
the
department
that
puts
them
up
the
mt
dept
of
transportation
also
generally
removes
all
of
the
private
memorials
placed
along
highways
per
the
original
complaint
of
this
post
leaving
only
these
official
markers
but
i
do
agree
it
s
insensitive
to
people
of
other
faiths
yes
the
same
way
pirates
made
sure
it
was
christian
booty
before
putting
a
cross
on
the
map
to
mark
where
they
buried
it
right
as
a
second
generation
atheist
if
anyone
puts
up
anything
with
a
cross
to
remember
me
by
i
m
gonna
haunt
them
out
of
spite
from
my
understanding
crosses
can
be
non
denominational
where
as
a
crucifix
obviously
isn
t
i
may
be
wrong
though
deleted
that
was
also
a
joke
maybe
you
only
drive
in
tunnels
but
i
just
drove
1000
miles
for
thanksgiving
and
i
can
assure
you
that
there
are
plenty
of
things
you
can
see
from
a
highway
edit
but
in
any
case
who
said
anything
about
highways
rt
4
isn
t
a
controlled
access
highway
and
roadside
memorials
pop
up
all
over
the
place
i
think
they
re
solar
powered
landscape
style
lights
but
i
ve
never
let
my
gaze
linger
long
enough
to
confirm
lol
they
re
also
very
cool
white
if
not
actually
blue
which
always
tickles
the
a
cop
instinct
even
though
i
drive
by
the
memorial
so
often
i
should
be
blind
to
it
by
now
i
think
it
s
even
worse
to
keep
changing
it
because
then
it
continues
to
grab
regular
commuters
attention
it
does
feel
like
that
s
part
of
it
i
usually
take
roadside
memorials
as
a
psa
reminding
me
that
driving
is
dangerous
and
we
need
to
take
it
seriously
guy
just
because
it
doesn
t
cause
everyone
to
fly
off
the
road
doesn
t
mean
that
it
s
not
a
distraction
definition
of
distract
is
learn
more
at
https
www
dictionary
com
browse
distract
the
costs
of
a
few
people
s
memorials
on
the
roads
throughout
the
state
would
be
wildly
expensive
and
far
more
than
a
cemetery
plot
if
those
folks
had
to
foot
the
entire
expense
of
the
state
department
that
was
necessary
to
support
it
otherwise
the
unrelated
taxpayers
would
be
just
subsidizing
cemetery
plots
on
state
property
anyway
introducing
additional
liabilities
and
willingly
so
i
m
gonna
pass
we
can
t
even
maintain
bridges
with
living
people
crossing
them
https

a
mwgfmwr
i
did
actually
but
thanks
for
playing
the
people
who
put
it
up
it
wouldn
t
be
a
law
that
has
to
be
rigorously
policed
but
it
would
set
the
expectation
that
it
should
be
a
temporary
memorial
and
not
something
they
should
maintain
in
perpetuity
let
the
convicts
do
it
when
they
do
the
roadside
garbage
detail
simple
as
that
thanks
for
answering
it
s
interesting
how
they
justify
it
i
agree
something
should
replace
the
memorials
that
are
too
large
that
was
an
x
we
ll
put
your

upside

people
driving

straying
off

into

or

urgggghhhhhhhhhhhhh
i
can
t
roll
my

hard
enough
it
s
painful
recycling
joke
more
like
garbage
joke
good
for
you
that
stuff
doesn
t
belong
on
the
highway
yeah
it
seems
insane
to
look
at
a
spot
where
someone
died
and
be
upset
by
the
little
solar
lights
rather
than
being
upset
by
the
fact
that
someone
fucking
died
there
so
you
re
saying
that
the
distraction
doesn
t
make
you
drive
any
less
safely
if
that
s
the
case
that
there
s
no
effect
on
safety
why
did
you
even
mention
it

mark

let
them
take
the
booze
as
well
i
must
have
been
holding
the
map
sideways
ty
for
the
info
my
ccd
teacher
was
definitely
wrong
then
this
was
also
like
10
years
ago
when
i
was
told
nice
probably
just
a
bit
cocked
nondenominational
in
a
christian
church
setting
in
my
personal
experience
means
any
other
christian
denomination
not
the
world
or
religion
at
large
if
you
don
t
love
me
at
my
worst
drought
you
don
t
deserve
me
at
my
other
worst
flooding
my
favorite
is
under
the
bridge
on
oaklawn
ave
across
from
campanella
lol
always
a
good
spot
for
at
least
1
person
to
get
stuck
in
every
single
time
we
get
a
lot
of
rain
meanwhile
i
m
waiting
to
see
how
many
people
stall
out
their
cars
on
that
one
street
in
cranston
knowing
full
well
how
often
it
gets
flooded
how
long
until
we
get
the
tv
shot
of
the
car
submerged
under
the
wilbur
avenue
train
bridge
i
was
about
to
head
that
way
how
bad
is
it
bald
hill
was
a
mistake
i
m
expecting
it
tonight
it
was
already
starting
to
look
a
little
flooded
this
morning
on
one
side
i
m
sure
it
s
gotten
worse
by
now
it
s
the
law
if
your
wipers
are
on
your
headlights
should
be
on
it
s
a
rhode
island
state
law
also
headlights
on
30
minutes
after
sunrise
and
30
minutes
before
sunset
truck
drivers
won
t
even
know
you
re
there
i
can
t
tell
you
how
hard
it
is
to
see
cars
in
my
mirrors
when
it
s
raining
also
the
left
lane
is
for
passing
not
speed
matching
the
car
to
your
right
if
you
can
t
see
the
sun
your
headlights
go
on
yep
and
slow
down
while
you
re
at
it
this
isn
t
a
race
especially
when
visibility
is
reduced
i
even
see
police
driving
in
the
rain
without
lights
on
it
s
insane
how
many
people
don
t
do
this
preach
so
many
grey
cars
swallowed
up
in
the
road
spray
makes
them
almost
invisible
louder
for
the
three
state
police
cruisers
on
295
rt6
who
didn
t
have
their
lights
on
today
and
the
one
i
saw
on
the
day
it
snowed
driving
like
a
fool
without
lights
on
days
like
this
the
color
of
the
cars
makes
them
impossible
to
see
without
lights
on
plus
its
the
law
in
some
states
like
sc
you
re
required
to
turn
on
our
hazards
in
this
kind
of
weather
i
don
t
understand
why
people
in
ri
don
t
want
to
make
themselves
visible
it
s
rhode
island
where
drivers
dont
believe
in
headlights
in
pea
soup
fog
heavy
rain
or
turn
signals
turn
on
your
heart
lights
let
them
shine
wherever
you
go
let
them
make
a
happy
glow
for
all
the
world
to
see
fk
i
m
old
me
understand
i
turn
light
on
now
blue
light
in
dash
come
on
xtra
brite
i
do
good
rite
i
thought
all
cars
have
automatic
headlights
my
car
is
almost
10
years
old
and
has
it
what
year
did
they
start
putting
automatic
headlights
in
why
would
someone
shut
them
off
it
s
not
like
they
stay
on
when
the
car
is
parked
lights
on
in
the
rain
or
dark
how
do
people
not
know
this
it
s
the
law
that
no
one
follows
i
almost
got
into
an
accident
on
95
the
other
day
it
wasn
t
raining
but
it
was
5
am
and
this
dude
didn
t
have
any
lights
on
not
even
parking
lights
i
tried
to
switch
lanes
cuz
i
didn
t
see
him
wtaf
is
wrong
with
people
first
time
i
was
driving
in
canada
early
90s
i
thought
it
odd
that
their
drivers
had
their
lights
on
during
the
day
turns
out
their
research
showed
that
the
increased
visibility
led
to
a
decrease
in
collisions
ever
since
then
i
turn
my
lights
on
whenever
i
drive
it
s
just
muscle
memory
for
me
at
this
point
and
yes
my
car
has
day
running
lights
but
i
still
switch
on
the
heads
i
m
open
minded
enough
to
accept
if
someone
has
a
good
reason
that
i
should
not
be
doing
this
though
my
car
doesn
t
give
the
option
of
turning
the
headlights
on
or
off
they
re
always
on
it
s
weird
driving
someone
else
s
car
for
whatever
reason
and
thinking
why
s
it
so
dark
what
do
you
expect
people
here
will
drive
on
a
normal
night
without
lights
on
take
away
rhode
islands
drivers
license
implement
drivers
retraining
we
dropped
the
ball
a
long
time
ago
too
many
people
know
a
guy
for
all
of
the
drivers
to
be
legitimate
most
cars
now
have
daytime
running
lights
that
are
relatively
bright
my
gripe
are
the
assholes
that
drive
around
in
a
car
that
has
rear
fog
lights
and
they
have
them
on
during
a
perfectly
clear
day
night
luckily
these
rear
fog
lights
are
only
available
on
a
few
car
manufacturers
usually
an
audi
or
jag
but
jesus
christ
they
are
ridiculously
blinding
if
you
re
driving
behind
them
hilarious
that
you
run
to
reddit
with
this
nah
the
law
is
not
for
torrential
downpour
headlights
are
required
when
the
windshields
wipers
are
on
so
even
for
a
light
rain
i
don
t
know
why
it
isn
t
just
a
federal
mandate
now
with
leds
everywhere
there
s
no
reason
to
not
just
have
the
headlight
and
taillights
on
all
the
time
it
s
the
state
law
in
ma
also
and
no
one
follows
the
law
i
see
cars
driving
in
the
pitch
black
without
lights
on
please
why
can
t
you
tell
us
no
they
re
speed
matching
it
s
the
national
sport
of
rhode
island
drivers
yep
you
re
technically
supposed
to
get
out
of
the
left
lane
asap
especially
if
there
s
someone
behind
you
dae
le
left
lane
is
for
passing
updoots
to
the
left
this
i
wish
more
people
would
simply
follow
this
i
also
think
driving
exams
should
include
a
question
about
when
it
s
appropriate
to
use
high
beams
but
that
s
a
rant
for
another
time
automatic
headlights
are
not
required
by
manufacturers
i
ve
seen
2005
vehicles
have
them
and
i
ve
seen
2020
vehicles
without
them
just
depends
on
the
manufacturer
and
the
model
i
ve
noticed
a
lot
of
automatic
lights
apparently
don
t
turn
on
the
taillights
which
is
also
a
problem
you
need
to
actually
turn
your
lights
on
for
them
all
to
go
on
my
car
is
over
10
years
old
and
a
base
model
without
automatic
headlights
i
don
t
know
if
drivers
turn
their
automatic
lights
off
but
i
always
turn
my
headlights
on
if
i
m
out
in
the
rain
i
have
automatic
headlights
and
they
dont
always
come
on
in
the
rain
depending
how
bright
it
is
while
raining
i
have
automatic
lights
in
my
personal
vehicle
and
it
stays
on
that
setting
always
my
company
truck
is
a
2017
with
blue
tooth
hands
free
back
up
camera
heated
mirrors
but
no
auto
lights
it
doesn
t
even
have
intermittent
wipers
or
cruise
control
who
does
that
i
personally
turn
my
auto
setting
off
because
my
car
seems
to
think
i
need
my
high
beams
on
at
all
times
and
never
recognizes
when
cars
are
driving
towards
me
you
d
think
cadillacs
from
the
mid
90s
would
turn
on
the
headlamps
if
the
wipers
were
on
for
more
than
a
few
seconds
and
if
you
had
auto
lamps
manually
switched
off
the
dash
would
say
headlamps
suggested
that
was
30
years
ago
there
are
so
many
cars
now
with
digital
gauge
clusters
that
are
always
backlit
and
have
daytime
running
lamps
but
no
automatic
headlamps
so
the
driver
sees
the
lit
dash
and
sees
light
in
front
of
them
but
they
literally
have
zero
tail
lamps
on
i
see
it
every
single
day
it
s
crazy
i
get
more
of
an
audience
than
just
yelling
from
behind
the
steering
wheel
into
the
void
you
can
only
yell
at
so
many
people
in
public
reddit
is
a
great
way
to
vent
never
in
the
fog
the
light
threshold
for
them
to
turn
on
varies
a
lot
too
my
auto
setting
consistently
turns
on
for
about
a
second
when
i
drive
under
overpasses
and
it
looks
like
i
m
flashing
the
cars
in
front
of
me
i
exclusively
turn
them
on
manually
my
automatic
headlights
don
t
come
on
until
way
after
the
threshold
where
i
turn
them
on
manually
they
don
t
automatically
turn
on
until
the
sun
is
about
completely
down
or
the
rain
is
so
thick
you
can
barely
even
drive
30mph
the
fact
that
you
feel
you
need
an
audience
is
sad
it
s
just
an
echo
chamber
the
message
isn
t
getting
through
to
anyone
who
needs
to
hear
it
because
of
that
it
s
dumb
if
you
frame
it
like
you
just
want
to
vent
or
need
emotional
support
from
the
horrors
you
ve
experienced
great
disguising
it
as
being
a
savior
of
our
roadways
is
laughable
and
frankly
sad
ma
offers
free
breakfast
and
lunch
to
all
students
during
covid
the
government
covered
the
costs
after
ma
continued
to
cover
the
costs
along
with
6
other
states
ma
does
something
first
california
follows
media
gives
california
all
the
credit
rinse
repeat
hell
yea
love
to
see
more
states
doing
this

never
be

my

have
always
had
access
to
free

and
my
oldest
is
13
they
go
so
far
as
to
bring
free
school
lunches
around
to
the
public
parks
and
playgrounds
in
the
summer
if
you
are
there
between
a

time
frame
you
can
grab
a
lunch
for
the
girls
who
have
the
coolers
at
the
entrance
no
questions
asked
completely
free
i
saw
this
pic
and
i
am
pretty
sure
that
there
are
several
states
that
started
doing
free
lunch
around
the
same
time
as
california
rhode
island
massachusetts
minnesota
etc
this
is
a

yes

free

lunches
my
kids
get
free
lunch
including
milk
however
if
they
bring
lunch
they
have
to
pay
for
milk
you
know
because
reasons
every
state
should
do
this
our
millionaires
tax
pays
for
it
thanks
oligarchs
whichever
state
did
it
first
it
s
a
great
thing
for
many
of
these
children
it
s
the
only
food
they
get
all
day
there
was
a
backpack
program
my
work
used
to
donate
to
for
non

days
they
were
given
out
with

drinks
for

i

the

of
the

if
all

dollars
went

like
this
that
just
benefit
the
whole
of

i
d
happily
pay
80
of
my
paycheck
instead
i
hate
that
i
pay

am
i
that
old
um
no
that
s
been
like
that
since
i
was
in
school
here
in
ohio
yes
for
like
years
too
idk
why
cali
is
getting
all
the
credit
as
the
first
school
to
do
it
shouldn
t
a
great
country
have
no
problem
feeding
and
providing
healthcare
for
its
children
yes
yep
yes
it
started
with
covid
funds
in
2021ish
and
was
continued
last
year
under
the
additional
revenue
brought
in
by
the
millionaire
s
tax
at
my
school
2014
we
had
reduced
10
cents
for
lunch
and
free
meals
but
you
had
to
fill
out
a
form
parent
here
massachusetts
has
been
doing
this
for
all
students
since
the
beginning
of
covid
prior
to
that
free
and
reduced
price
breakfast
and
lunch
have
been
available
to
low
income
families
for
decades
since
at
least
the
90s
maybe
even
before
that
in
ma
each
town
city
made
their
own
rules
around
this
until
2022
when
it
became
state
wide
so
some
school
districts
in
ma
have
been
doing
this
for
over
a
decade
but
it
wasn
t
until
recently
it
became
the
official
state
policy
i
thought
the
millionaire
tax
paid
for
this
along
with
free
public
busses
and
many
would
actually
believe
this
news
i
actually
went
to
school
in
ny
back
in
the
80
s
and
all
student
got
free
breakfast
and
lunch
in
the
schools
i
went
to
they
even
had
a
summer
lunch
program
at
the
schools
for
the
community
for
free
wasn
t
massachusetts
the
first
yep
california
is
not
the
first
i
don
t
think
we
were
the
first
but
it
started
for
us
in
school
year
22
23
mass
only
does
free
breakfast
for
all
students
lunch
isn
t
free
for
all
except
during
covid
which
i
believe
was
federal
massachusetts
until
at
least
2022
post
covid
still
relied
on
the
community
eligible
provision
and
or
provision
2
to
feed
students
for
free
these
programs
had
to
be
applied
for
and
were
decided
on
a
distinct
by
district
basis
based
on
poverty
levels
in
the
area
i
haven
t
been
in
k12
dining
since
2022
so
this
may
have
changed
but
california
legislated
free
breakfast
lunch
and
amp
for
all
students
on
the
state
level
first
my
daughter
is
a
first
grader
she
has
had
free
breakfast
and
lunch
since
kindergarten
if
i
forgot
to
pack
snacks
they
always
had
free
snacks
to
her
during
summer
break
you
can
also
go
to
school
to
pick
up
free
breakfast
and
lunch
for
your
kids
michigan
has
been
doing
this
for
2
or
3
years
ever
since
the
federal
funding
stopped
the
state
has
funded
it
with
our
flip
in
legislative
control
it
probably
ends
next
budget
cycle
both
states
are
doing
a
great
job
at
being
progressive
and
setting
an
example
for
other
states
to
follow
we
need
them
all
what
about
mass
that
s
an
old
article
the
repost
bots
sent
it
today
yes
since
covid
you
re
the
one
who
mentioned
massachusetts
and
yes
i
said
ohio
because
read
what
it
actually
says
in
the
picture
at
my
kids
school
they
do
free
doubles
fat
kid
in
me
has
questions
since
when
taxpayer
subsidized
not
free
i
think
it
s
town
by
town
edit
nope
i
m
super
wrong
thanks
to
commenters
for
sorting
me
out
deleted
it
s
not
free
taxpayers
are
footing
the
bill
for
this
massachusetts
does
not
do
this
at
the
state
level
most
districts
provide
free
or
reduced
breakfast
and
lunch
on
an
as
needed
basis
with
a
few
providing
them
for
all
students
so
families
need
to
apply
for
assistance
and
give
their
full
financial
information
and
so
on
humiliating
process
really
but
a
certain
party
keeps
preventing
better
actions
at
the
state
level
and
the
other
party
doesn
t
care
enough
to
ram
it
through
mass
does
it
just
increased
the
taxes
a
lot
to
cover
it
i
always
had
to
pay
for
both
high
school
class
of
2020
so
idk
if
it
changed
since
then
but
afaik
we
don
t
how
that
many
kids
need
a
free
breakfast
and
or
lunch
is
beyond
my
comprehension
mass
residents
covered
the
costs
not
mass
idk
if
covid
counts
separately
but
ca
did
this
for
2022
2023
school
year
and
it
looks
like
mass
was
soon
after
with
the
press
release
i
found
released
in
2023
doesn
t
matter
who
s
first
just
happy
both
states
do
it
sometimes
there
are
hidden
benefits
to
doing
things
well
but
quietly
ca
can
sometimes
function
as
a
little
bit
of
a
heat
shield
for
other
blue
states
in
the
country
hey
i
m
kinda
happy
gets
all
the
credit
it
means
dorito
mussolini
will
probably
go
there
and
fight
them
california
removed
8th
grade
algebra
because
white
asian
students
were
overperforming
in
math
compared
to
black
hispanic
students
so
in
order
to
equalize
things
they
decided
to
take
away
education
from
the
white
asian
students
in
the
name
of
equity
cambridge

to

cambridge
schools
are
divided
over
middle
school
algebra
cali
legalized
weed
first
but
fore
the
most
part
you
re
right
i
remember
some
i
think
you
had
to
qualify
kids
getting
free
breakfast
and
lunch
when
i
was
in
school
in
nb
back
in
the
1980
s
state
wide
started
during
covid
and
now
continuing
after
cover
due
to
2024
change
hasn
t
minnesota
been
too
are
they
allowed
to
take
the
full
free
lunch
including
milk
even
if
they
bring
lunch
and
then
give
away
everything
but
the
milk
i
mean
we
all
do
thank
you
to
everyone
yep
thanks
for
the
absolutely
un
nutritious
sugar
soy
artificial
crap
posing
as
food
pawned
on
to
our
kids
to
choose
instead
of
the
healthy
options
sent
from
home
but
a
lot
of
it
does
go
to
stuff
like
this
and
libraries
and
whatever
i
went
to
high
school
04
08
and
they
always
had
breakfast
the
caveat
was
that
most
busses
showed
up
5
minutes
before
first
period
unfortunately
i
think
it
has
in
the
past
been
very
district
dependent
in
wealthy
areas
kids
generally
eat
breakfast
at
home
and
most
don
t
need
breakfast
from
school
so
if
you
lived
in
a
nice
town
then
you
probably
didn
t
have
school
breakfast
but
in
districts
where
there
is
widespread
food
insecurity
and
most
kids
would
qualify
for
free
lunch
free
breakfast
would
be
very
beneficial
and
it
would
be
more
likely
for
a
school
breakfast
program
to
get
established
provided
funding
was
available
i
think
you
re
a
bit
lost
this
is
the
massachusetts
sub
that
s
not
correct

press
release
from

i
m
okay
with
free
breakfast
and
lunch
but
there
should
be
a
work
requirement
i
m
fed
up
with
these
free
loading
kids
that
expect
to
be
given
food
just
because
they
re
hungry
i
am
a
retiree
i
firmly
believe
that
all
of
our
children
should
be
getting
fed
quality
food
when
at
school
no
questions
asked
it
is
just
part
of
a
caring
functioning
society
it
used
to
be
done
by
family
income
which
made
more
sense
than
just
every
child
getting
free
lunch
well
yeah
where
do
you
think
the
government
gets
its
money
we
pay
taxes
the
government
uses
that
money
to
help
the
community
in
a
perfect
world
anyway
you
show
them
kids
children
eating
is
the
best
thing
my
taxes
can
go
to
tell
me
you
don
t
understand
taxes
without
telling
me
yeah
that
s
not
something
that
generally
needs
to
be
spelled
out
massachusetts
has
done
it
long
before
covid
my
son
had
free
lunches
all
the
way
up
until
he
graduated
last
year
it
started
when
he
was
in
the
first
grade
i
think
at
that
point
though
it
was
just
district
by
district
i
think
it
became
a
statewide
thing
later
on
we
got
it
statewide
for
school
year
22
23
as
well
seriously
let
ca
be
the
target
i
took
algebra
in
eighth
grade
in
ohio
i
had
a
classmate
that
did
it
in
7th
grade
by
the
end
of
high
school
i
was
taking
linear
algebra
and
calc
4
at
the
local
university
i
mention
this
to
demonstrate
how
i
m
shocked
that
cambridge
of
all
places
can
t
keep
up
with
ohio
schools
california
allows
individual
schools
to
choose
whether
they
offer
algebra
1
in
8th
grade
according
to
the
sources
i
found
the
claim
that
it
was
removed
because
certain
races
are
too
good
at
it
doesn
t
seem
to
be
supported
by
evidence
is
it
possible
you
fell
for
a
bad
faith
misrepresentation
of
what
happened
or
are
making
one
yourself
wtf
you
really
didn
t
sum
up
what
i
read
very
well
and
judging
by
your
welcome
to
the
democratic
party
comment
i
m
just
going
to
assume
you
re
personally
bothered
by
the
race
part
and
only
absorbed
that
part
of
the
article
yeah
afaik
there
has
always
been
options
for
those
who
qualified
i
think
if
the
parents
were
on
food
stamps
but
it
was
one
of
those
things
that
would
single
out
the
poor
kids
because
they
wouldn
t
have
to
pay
at
checkout
there
was
a
lot
of
shame
and
bullying
that
went
on
as
a
result
kids
would
also
run
up
tabs
because
their
parents
wouldn
t
always
have
money
to
give
them
now
it
s
provided
for
every
child
no
questions
asked
that
has
been
going
on
till
now
to
my
knowledge
unless
they
recently
stopped
it
deleted
on
the
contrary
now
that
lunch
programs
don
t
need
to
be
profitable
or
subsidize
their
own
funding
they
can
actually
focus
on
being
more
healthy
and
diverse
they
are
no
longer
competing
with
the
vending
machines
you
can
also
always
send
food
in
from
home
no
one
will
take
it
out
of
your
child
s
hands
the
school
lunch
requirements
have
very
specific
standards
and
the
individual
schools
districts
make
decisions
about
how
to
adhere
to
those
standards
i
don
t
know
of
any
school
that
offers
a
6
pack
of
donuts
for
lunch
but
that
sounds
like
an
issue
that
you
should
take
up
with
your
schools
food
service
department
yeah
fuck
those
kids
who
don
t
have
parents
or
guardians
that
can
always
provide
enough
healthy
and
nutritious
meals
better
yet
take
them
and
put
them
in
a
home
or
with
some
strange
family
or
a
series
of
homes
instead
of
just
feeding
them
something
in
school
yeah
not
in
my
district
edit
kids
can
still
bring
their
own
but
there
s
free
breakfast
and
lunch
daily
not
nasty
foods
either
nice
daily
hot
lunch
and
nutritious
foods
daily
that
might
have
been
it
i
graduated
in
2012
and
all
i
can
remember
was
you
could
buy
snacks
in
the
morning
so
chips
cookies
drinks
stuff
like
that
but
i
also
biked
most
days
or
the
bus
dropped
us
off
right
before
first
period
i
see
i
had
no
idea
i
did
attend
an
affluent
school
district
all
we
had
was
like
cookies
chips
maybe
fruit
and
some
warm
beverages
if
we
got
in
early
enough
besides
that
nothing
else
thanks
for
the
insight
i
understand
that
but
the
picture
states
california
so
i
think
you
re
the
one
lost
lol
which
part
and
i
have
a
problem
when
people
call
it
free
free
free
it
s
not
free
gotcha
oh
no
the
state
is
paying
to
feed
our
children
what
a
bad
thing
for
the
state
to
do
without
creating
extra
bureaucratic
tape
to
prove
you
need
food
well
there
was
a
certain
stigma
associated
with
getting
a
free
lunch
while
others
paid
for
it
plus
there
was
all
that
administration
to
collect
money
cashiers
etc
so
there
s
some
cost
savings
to
making
it
free
for
everybody
instead
of
determining
who
needed
to
pay
and
who
didn
t
and
then
of
course
there
were
those
who
qualified
but
didn
t
do
the
paperwork
so
they
were
paying
when
they
didn
t
need
to
i
m
happy
my
taxes
go
to
helping
kids
eat
shouldn
t
be
so
difficult
have
we
done
breakfast
too
it
was
statewide
starting
22
23
my
district
has
been
doing
it
since
covid
20
21
you
re
right
not
every
district
mine
was
like
3
3
50
for
a
meal
before
covid
it
wasn
t
free
for
all
students
and
some
didn
t
include
breakfast
massachusetts
has
done
it
long
before
covid
i
think
it
became
a
statewide
thing
later
on
if
some
random
districts
did
it
before
it
became
a
statewide
thing
then
it
wouldn
t
be
correct
to
say
that
massachusetts
has
done
it
long
before
covid
welcome
to
the
democratic
party
your
example
is
a
town
not
an
entire
state
yeah
i
don
t
think
the
school
districts
got
that
message
i
would
love
to
see
organic
soy
free
low
sugar
food
in
the
schools
but
i
was
warned
by
the
school
nurse
before
the
year
even
started
dangling
a
free
6
pack
of
chocolate
donuts
in
front
of
a
kindergarten
child
that
then
gets
to
choose
that
versus
what
gets
sent
from
home
good
luck
i
m
surprised
at
the
amount
of
negs
maybe
it
s
just
my
school
district
not
providing
well
but
if
fair
share
dollars
are
paying
for
garbage
food
then
they
can
keep
the
first
i
m
not
op
secondly
the
title
literally
says
doesn
t
ma
do
this
too
nobody
mentioned
ohio
however
ma
doesn
t
only
offer
free
breakfast
they
offer
free
lunch
which
continues
well
past
covid
i
do
remember
in
middle
school
the
children
who
received
free
meals
had
to
show
the
cashier
their
orange
laminated
card
and
i
definitely
remember
kids
getting
made
fun
of
for
it
circa
2002
not
all
schools
offer
breakfast
breakfast
i
can
t
remeber
because
we
always
ate
before
school
so
maybe
it
went
statewide
during
the
beginning
of
covid
i
m
sure
this
is
district
dependent
but
there
are
definitely
not
any
chocolate
donuts
being
offered
at
my
kid
s
schools
i
have
one
in
elementary
and
one
in
middle
in
general
the
lunches
i
see
offered
appear
to
be
pretty
healthy
a
6
pack
of
chocolate
donuts
where
the
hell
do
live
where
they
do
this
my
district
cannot
by
law
offer
sugary
foods
it
states
it
s
the
1st
state
to
do
that
which
is
a
lie
i
stand
corrected
as
of
2023
2024
school
year
it
is
effective
permanently
forgot
double
lunch
isn
t
free
well
done
rhode
island
mom
you
single
then
that
s
probably
why
california
is
getting
credit
here
they
do
both
i
m
wondering
if
ca
was
the
first
to
do
both
breakfast
and
lunch
even
if
ma
introduced
lunch
first
but
i
didn
t
go
to
school
here
and
i
have
no
idea
it
went
statewide
in
school
year
22
23
that
s
not
the
beginning
of
covid
might
be
better
to
fly
under
the
radar
for
a
while
tbh
iirc
they
technically
passed
the
bill
before
we
did
to
extend
the
covid
free
lunch
program
that
being
said
ya
they
re
the
first
but
not
by
much
p
ebt
was
started
april
17th
2020
this
program
also
covered
statewide
meals
at
designated
pickup
locations
that
is
not
the
same
it
went
statewide
for
all
schools
in
22
23
the
programs
for
it
due
to
covid
are
different
crazy
that
united
is
both
the
most
expensive
and
least
effective
plan
listed
bluecrossblueshield
of
mass
is
expensive
but
they
have
never
given
me
nay
issues
with
claims
denials
or
being
out
of
network
for
the
greater
boston
area
interesting
to
see
that
the
company
that
has
the
highest
claim
denial
rate
among
the
big
players
also
charges
the
most
just
the
fact
that
ma
residents
has
this
many
options
is
at
least
something
some
places
you
have
the
insurance
to
choose
from
i
ve
had
blue
cross
for
20
years
in
ma
and
never
had
a
problem
honestly
like
these
are
pretty
good
options
for
non
employer
subsidized
health
insurance
you
ve
got
cheap
options
three
under
100
mo
which
probably
don
t
offer
very
much
one
mid
priced
at
240
mo
and
then
some
pricier
plans
which
will
offer
a
lot
more
coverage
imo
harvard
pilgrim
and
bcbs
are
the
best
options
here
but
more
expensive
obviously
i
ve
been
really
happy
with
bcbs
for
15
years
but
it
s
expensive
even
employer
subsidized
it
s
a
shame
that
this
is
probably
the
best
set
of
options
for
anybody
getting
insurance
outside
of
an
employer
if
you
can
swing
mgb
health
plan
absolutely
do
they
are
owned
by
mgh
brigham
and
will
approve
anything
no
questions
asked
if
you
get
care
in
mgh
or
brigham
you
don
t
even
need
to
worry
about
prior
authorizations
i
looked
for
a
pcp
at
mgb
back
in
2018
and
the
wait
times
were
under
a
year
do
you
get
subsidies
i
believe
that
wellsense
is
a
non
profit
run
by
bmc
and
my
wife
has
them
for
her
medicare
advantage
plan
our
son
has
some
plan
related
to
mgb
and
he
is
extremely
happy
with
it
total
cost
for
it
last
year
was
14k
or
1k
month
i
m
guessing
the
really
cheap
plans
include
an
aca
subsidy
and
the
expensive
ones
don
t
so
for
your
income
level
you
get
a
choice
of
aca
medicaid
subsidized
plans
and
non
subsidized
plans
am
i
getting
that
right
i
had
the
tufts
one
when
i
used
the
hc
but
next
year
they
won
t
be
accepted
by
most
places
because
they
couldn
t
come
to
a
deal
i
would
look
into
fallon
health
if
you
can
afford
it
bluecross
is
the
way
to
go
imo
i
ve
heard
good
things
about
united
healthcare
i
am
very
happy
with
tufts
are
these
hmo
or
ppos
it
s
sad
i
work
for
a
good
company
with
a
fairly
solid
benefits
package
but
they
use
uhc
my
husband
lost
his
job
so
i
was
going
to
add
him
to
my
insurance
but
we
have
uhc
so
it
was
going
to
cost
more
than
200
per
paycheck
to
add
him
also
found
out
the
same
medication
we
both
take
he
can
get
it
cheaper
with
just
the
rx
discount
card
than
i
was
through
my
insurance
wtf
it
s
time
for
massachusetts
to
lead
in
universal
healthcare
please
call
your
state
representatives
and
demand
they
pass
this
https
masscare
org
that
s
the
ceo
replacement
fee
exactly
my
thoughts
plans
vary
my
bcbs
doesn
t
cover
diabetic
visits
450
everytime
i
go
so
glad
i
have
health
insurance
wait
until
you
go
into
heart
failure
then
get
denied
because
you
didn
t
list
that
your
family
had
previous
heart
conditions
you
had
no
idea
about
to
see
it
so
plainly
is
something
very
true
point
had
it
in
my
youth
and
it
was
great
bit
rich
for
my
blood
at
the
moment
unfortunately
yeah
while
i
m
grateful
to
receive
any
help
at
all
it
s
frustrating
that
the
most
affordable
options
really
get
you
nowhere
i
ll
legally
be
insured
but
it
s
difficult
to
actually
get
seen
by
anyone
in
a
timely
manner
stop
sugar
coating
wellsense
is
the
old
bmc
healthnet
plan
these
are
all
the
subsidized
options
these
prices
include
the
federal
subsidy
yes
however
the
way
i
understand
it
these
are
the
subsidized
options
i
have
for
my
qualifications
level
of
course
there
are
other
private
options
for
those
who
can
pay
ah
okay
thanks
for
the
tip
i
picked
the
90
tufts
plan
because
rent
already
gets
me
however
i
figure
it
won
t
actually
get
me
in
anywhere
i
ll
look
further
into
your
suggestions
fool
since
govt
got
involved
with
healthcare
the
system
is
collapsing
premiums
are
thru
the
roof
and
people
have
to
change
their
primary
care
physicians
3
times
every
5
years
get
the
govt
completely
out
of
it
trainwreck
increased
security
costs
i
agree
with
price
but
on
the
other
hand
my
wife
and
i
were
lucky
enough
to
use
in
vitro
when
we
had
trouble
having
my
son
it
only
cost
the
copay
i
know
some
people
who
had
insurance
but
still
had
to
pay
a
significant
amount
hazard
pay
to
be
fair
to
them
point
32
is
a
non
profit
as
opposed
to
uhc
under
the
current
system
in
ma
most
for
profits
don
t
want
to
do
business
here
as
an
aside
point
32
underwent
a
rapid
expansion
in
the
last
5
7
years
that
has
left
them
in
a
rocky
and
transitory
position
so
some
of
this
is
probably
just
related
to
their
own
internal
realignment
on
a
scale
of
0
10
how
close
to
murdering
our
executives
do
you
consider
yourself
to
be
interesting
as
a
retired
md
who
used
to
deal
with
prior
authorizations
and
appeals
i
can
say
harvard
pilgrim
tufts
before
they
merged
and
blue
cross
of
ma
were
all
much
better
quicker
to
process
pas
and
reasonable
when
appeals
were
needed
than
united
healthcare
ever
was
no
health
insurance
is
perfect
of
course
ayuh
they
re
scared
lol
i
haven
t
had
the
horror
stories
with
harvard
pilgrim
and
just
about
everything
is
covered
i
m
not
happy
but
absolutely
not
upset
with
them
and
in
no
what
hold
the
resentment
i
would
if
on
other
plans
uhc
denied
1
out
of
3
requests
from
doctors
for
coverage
1
out
of
3
hphc
is
under
4
last
i
looked
now
you
want
to
talk
respond
with
you
re
next
and
see
what
happens
edit
for
the
credulous
don
t
actually
do
this
this
is
jokes
my
health
connector
hphc
plan
went
up
to
450
mo
so
i
dropped
them
for
the
147
mo
wellsense
plan
with
the
same
coverage
so
i
ll
give
them
a
where
s
your
ceo
live
10
i
mean
considering
they
peaced
the
fuck
out
for
3
months
when
they
got
hacked
last
year
and
left
members
up
shit
creek
this
is
pretty
rich
i
have
them
and
they
ve
never
given
me
a
hassle
with
approvals
for
the
million
appts
and
meds
i
m
on
i
don
t
like
my
deductible
but
that
s
the
fault
of
my
employer
they
re
trying
to
figure
out
if
they
should
double
the
size
of
their
security
team
i
received
one
before
the
murder
so
i
m
not
sure
i
d
read
too
much
into
it
i
have
them
no
complaints
never
gave
us
the
run
around
and
seemed
to
be
pretty
easy
i
ve
braced
myself
for
fights
with
my
insurance
and
hp
is
always
like
hey
buddy
all
taken
care
of
have
a
good
one
honestly
they
ve
been
fine
for
me
however
i
have
united
for
dental
and
can
confirm
all
of
the
horror
stories
my
dentist
s
secretary
said
they
were
ready
to
drop
united
as
an
accepted
provider
because
of
non
payment
my
cleanings
were
covered
under
my
plan
yet
8
months
after
a
cleaning
when
i
go
back
for
another
they
said
united
still
had
not
paid
them
all
of
these
companies
need
to
be
held
responsible
but
some
are
certainly
far
worse
i
ve
had
hp
at
two
separate
jobs
and
honestly
they
are
not
bad
at
all
i
use
hphc
and
have
no
complaints
granted
my
doctor
s
office
runs
interference
with
them
more
than
i
do
but
in
my
interactions
with
them
they
seem
reasonable
i
love
this
it
s
working
for
reference
mr
show
season
3
episode
5
i
was
with
harvard
community
health
plan
when
they
started
up
and
i
loved
them
i
really
thought
they
would
be
a
national
model
tl
dr
please
don
t
shoot
us
how
am
i
doing
absolutely
shitting
myself
because
i
can
get
hrt
now
but
i
ve
absolutely
no
goddamn
way
to
get
to
a
planned
parenthood
without
my
family
knowing
and
shooting
down
any
chance
of
getting
it
again
even
if
i
could
100
get
it
i
know
for
a
fact
you
d
make
it
a
living
hell
to
keep
unless
you
are
also
scared
that
your
ceo
is
next
just
recently
decided
to
stay
w
tufts
medicare
point
32
after
considering
all
the
available
options
i
fortunately
don
t
have
serious
medical
issues
or
expensive
rx
but
they
have
the
best
coverage
expand
medicare
i
think
this
is
worthy
of
talking
about
i
don
t
think
you
can
have
a
healthcare
company
that
s
also
publicly
traded
please
eli5
but
to
me
you
re
either
in
the
business
of
providing
the
best
care
possible
which
eats
into
your
bottom
line
or
you
re
in
the
business
of
maximizing
your
shareholders
value
which
entails
racking
in
as
much
money
as
possible
and
then
paying
out
as
little
as
possible
which
is
why
i
m
ok
with
hphc
my
wife
has
what
we
believe
is
autoimmune
and
they
are
making
sure
the
tests
are
done
for
a
proper
diagnosis
there
is
a
doctor
shortage
but
that
s
not
the
providers
fault
it
s
congresses
fault
tufts
also
went
under
the
point32
banner
and
maintained
their
non
profit
status
as
well
11
for
all
all
of
them
health
new
england
is
the
worst
i
think
hphc
is
under
4
where
did
you
find
this
statistic
seriously
tho
you
mean
it
s
your
employer
s
fault
that
you
don
t
have
free
healthcare
here
s
a
thought
launch
your
own
business
and
pay
for
your
own
medical
insurance
and
any
other
benefits
you
want
or
keep
whining
i
hear
that
s
really
effective
i
got
that
email
before
luigi
did
his
thing
if
that
s
what
you
were
referring
to
i
genuinely
wish
i
could
help
you
out
that
sounds
terrible
i
ve
had
tufts
for
years
never
had
an
issue
with
them
and
i
ve
had
serious
illnesses
single
payer
no
thanks
the
assassination
prompted
me
to
dump
uhc
medicare
advantage
before
they
screwed
me
their
affiliation
with
aarp
fooled
me
i
was
dumb
to
gamble
on
a
for
profit
company
when
i
had
the
option
of
non
profit
company
i
should
have
realized
that
uhc
marketing
claims
were
too
good
to
be
true
a
sure
sign
of
a
con
to
start
i
think
the
whole
system
needs
reform
and
for
profit
care
neither
providers
nor
insurers
fit
well
into
my
policy
views
that
said
for
profit
status
and
quality
care
are
not
inherently
at
odds
it
s
just
easily
corrupted
tax
status
aside
insurers
role
in
the
system
is
to
be
the
payer
as
part
of
that
role
they
are
charged
along
with
the
govt
with
implementing
cost
controls
for
example
as
part
of
setting
provider
rates
insurers
negotiate
with
large
provider
systems
think
massgeneral
brigham
those
rates
are
then
in
part
set
cost
of
care
across
all
providers
in
all
areas
of
the
state
with
a
goal
of
providing
the
best
quality
of
care
for
the
lowest
cost
in
effect
they
re
acting
as
the
patient
advocates
on
cost
which
not
only
befits
the
direct
policy
holder
but
the
whole
state
which
contributes
massive
sums
of
money
toward
health
care
subsidies
health
policy
is
often
framed
as
questions
of
quality
access
and
cost
insurers
have
strong
insight
into
all
3
areas
they
have
immense
data
and
teams
of
doctors
and
actuaries
that
are
able
to
review
claims
to
ensure
a
patient
is
getting
the
best
care
for
the
best
cost
this
is
checked
by
loss
ratio
laws
a
concept
every
state
and
the
federal
govt
has
that
regulates
the
percentage
of
premiums
that
goes
toward
care
vs
administrative
expenses
think
profits
kind
of
the
aca
set
the
lowest
loss
ratio
at
80
care

admin
most
states
are
higher
in
a
healthy
system
denials
are
part
of
quality
and
cost
controls
a
public
system
would
still
operate
the
same
way
the
largest
insurer
in
the
country
is
cms
they
routinely
deny
care
success
is
highly
contingent
on
the
company
though
and
the
way
they
manage
their
business
which
can
lead
to
high
variability
and
breakdown
how
is
it
on
congress
gen
you
re
about
to
get
the
best
healthcare
you
ve
ever
seen
complementary
bi
yearly
full
body
mris
your
choice
of
single
malt
scotch
before
checkups
you
name
it
oh
that
s
lovely
i
ll
add
that
to
the
reasons
i
m
looking
for
a
new
job
they
were
just
purchased
by
point32
uh
no
it
s
my
employer
who
chose
the
plans
to
offer
to
us
because
that
s
the
way
it
works
they
chose
plans
with
a
shitty
deductible
do
you
know
why
it
s
shitty
to
me
as
in
why
my
opinion
is
that
it
s
garbage
i
have
a
progressive
neurological
disease
that
s
expensive
as
fuck
to
manage
in
the
current
healthcare
system
i
have
to
pay
close
attention
to
my
benefits
who
the
fuck
is
whining
i
never
said
shit
about
wanting
free
healthcare
ok
yeah
just
launch
a
business
very
easy
and
do
able
in
this
economy
get
out
of
town
if
you
don
t
mind
me
asking
who
did
you
switch
to
my
mom
is
about
to
make
the
switch
from
uhc
and
is
completely
overwhelmed
with
choices
and
options
anything
i
can
do
to
help
her
narrow
it
down
to
a
company
that
will
at
least
pretend
to
do
better
by
her
would
make
me
feel
better
and
her
as
well
no
pressure
just
figured
i
d
ask
i
feel
like
your
argument
is
a
compelling
defense
of
third
party
insurers
but
not
for
them
being
for
profit
the
pressure
to
increase
profits
shareholder
value
corrupts
the
system
with
an
external
motive
on
congress
you
mean
lobbying
point
32
has
a
federal
operation
but
they
re
not
large
enough
of
a
a
carrier
to
play
on
national
politics
on
their
own
how
it
should
be
you
complained
that
the
deductible
was
is
the
fault
of
your
employer
unless
you
re
paying
towards
your
health
insurance
whining
that
you
have
a
deductible
whining
that
you
don
t
have
free
healthcare
sorry
to
hear
you
re
dealing
with
a
serious
illness
so
am
i
if
you
can
t
launch
your
own
business
and
cover
the
benefits
you
want
then
don
t
whine
about
it
few
things
worse
than
people
who
b
tch
about
the
world
not
submitting
to
their
requirements
sorry
i
was
referring
to
the
doctor
shortage
it
s
been
decades
since
congress
expanded
the
number
of
residency
spots
where
doctors
train
after
med
school
so
med
schools
can
t
accept
more
students
so
the
population
is
growing
but
the
number
of
new
doctors
is
stagnant
this
is
news
to
me
congress
regulates
how
many
residency
spots
there
are
wouldn
t
this
come
down
to
the
capacity
of
the
various
teaching
hospitals
they
ve
instead
allowed
lots
of
np
pa
schools
to
open
since
they
graduate
in
2
3
yrs
don
t
do
residency
and
have
the
same
billable
hr
as
physicians
despite
physicians
doing
7
14
yrs
school
training
app
lobbyists
are
very
successful
nope
it
s
medicare
funded
so
it
s
limited
by
congress
maddening

someone
doing
what
those
on
the
right
seem
to
always
do
lately
politicizing
every
single
topic
even
when
it
has
nothing
to
do
with
politics
electrostatic
sweater
puppet
neuropathy
we
are
moving
from
the
west
coast
to
the
greater
boston
area
soon
looking
for
a
bit
of
advice
about
housing
and
budgets
my
partner
and
i
previously
lived
in
boston
as
students
and
are
now
planning
to
move
back
with
established
careers
and
two
small
kiddos
we
need
to
be
close
ideally
30
min
or
less
to
both
watertown
and
somerville
for
work
school
situations
we
are
planning
on
first
renting
then
buying
we
understand
that
cost
of
living
is
high
but
coming
from
a
vvhcol
place
e
g
an
older
3b1b
was
about
1
7m
average
the
areas
we
are
looking
at
seem
like
a
good
deal
we
are
renting
now
but
have
a
budget
of
about
1m
1
4m
for
our
first
home
looking
at
newton
watertown
belmont
arlington
etc
areas
hhi
between
300k
400k
and
we
ve
saved
enough
for
a
sizeable
down
payment
a
couple
questions
1
is
our
budget
feasible
for
a
turnkey
home
with
3
4
bedrooms
in
those
areas
a
cursory
look
at
zillow
tells
me
yes
but
i
take
everything
on
there
with
a
grain
of
salt
2
what
cities
neighborhoods
would
be
best
for
a
family
with
young
kids
from
the
ones
i
listed
that
have
good
commutes
to
somerville
watertown
we
like
parks
biking
family
activities
etc
maybe
some
walkability
to
restaurants
or
pedestrian
areas
if
possible
thanks
my
fianc
and
i
placed
an
offer
on
a
house
in
westfield
last
weekend
and
the
seller
accepted
we
are
selling
our
condo
in
south
fl
to
purchase
the
house
in
ma
we
re
very
excited
for
the
move
but
we
know
that
westfield
is
red
we
did
our
research
and
looked
at
crime
rates
unemployment
rates
and
education
all
were
acceptable
we
drove
around
town
went
to
ocean
state
job
lot
and
friendly
s
just
for
the
hell
of
it
we
didn
t
see
or
feel
any
discrimination
for
the
short
amount
of
time
we
were
there
but
as
a
mixed
race
lgbtq
couple
we
are
still
wondering
if
we
ll
be
safe
does
anyone
have
insight
on
westfield
and
if
we
might
experience
anything
that
could
make
us
feel
unsafe
we
re
going
from
a
red
state
blue
city
to
a
blue
state
red
city
maybe
we
re
overthinking
it
but
if
anyone
has
any
reassuring
info
it
would
be
appreciated
tia
not
sure
where
to
begin
i
m
old
as
dirt
i
would
say
old
as
shit
but
shit
has
to
decay
into
dirt
so
dirt
is
older
i
m
old
as
dirt
i
m
also
trans
had
surgery
decades
ago
and
i
live
in
the
south
my
state
avoided
becoming
new
texas
by
one
elected
official
so
the
writing
is
on
the
wall
that
s
for
sure
i
m
going
to
have
to
leave
when
i
retire
this
makes
me
sad
but
that
s
ok
it
s
not
the
same
as
it
was
in
the
past
so
my
plan
is
to
winter
in
mexico
and
summer
in
mass
only
thing
is
i
ve
never
retired
before
so
i
m
not
sure
how
to
do
this
my
first
goal
is
to
just
get
residency
in
mass
get
a
drivers
license
start
paying
taxes
the
whole
9
yards
given
that
i
m
going
to
mobile
between
warmer
and
colder
places
how
do
i
do
that
i
don
t
think
i
can
just
rent
a
place
in
mass
for
6
months
out
of
the
year
and
a
place
in
mexico
for
6
months
i
kinda
need
a
solid
address
or
something
that
stays
in
one
place
while
im
moving
around
anyone
know
of
how
this
is
done
also
anyone
know
of
any
trans
organizations
that
can
help
with
the
organizing
i
don
t
need
financial
support
but
i
know
nothing
about
massachusetts
so
i
ll
be
a
fish
outta
water
for
a
while
i
can
t
speak
to
your
jobs
but
some
general
advice
on
purchasing
owning
close
to
boston
the
charles
river
is
the
great
divider
newton
well
depending
where
in
newton
has
a
portion
of
it
south
of
the
charles
living
south
of
the
charles
and
commuting
north
when
not
near
93
or
95
can
be
painful
i
think
for
your
jobs
it
likely
isn
t
a
huge
problem
but
just
know
that
having
your
life
mostly
on
one
side
of
the
charles
river
just
makes
things
easier
the
closer
you
are
to
boston
that
being
said
i
am
curious
how
important
schooling
is
for
you
if
you
plan
to
go
to
public
school
belmont
and
newton
are
generally
more
highly
regarded
locally
but
you
trade
in
for
a
sleepier
set
of
towns
watertown
and
arlington
have
historically
had
less
emphasis
on
their
public
schools
but
that
is
changing
there
has
been
large
investments
in
high
schools
in
those
towns
finally
consider
public
transport
wants
needs
newton
and
belmont
both
have
the
commuter
rail
while
arlington
and
watertown
only
have
busses
not
that
it
s
bad
but
just
another
thing
to
think
about
if
you
are
looking
for
slightly
livelier
situations
in
that
there
s
more
stuff
to
do
then
living
in
somerville
itself
or
living
in
cambridge
would
also
be
a
good
idea
too
and
the
commutes
would
be
extremely
reasonable
then
for
watertown
hopefully
a
bus
brings
whoever
needs
to
get
there
easily
otherwise
a
car
will
do
and
you
could
likely
commute
via
the
red
line
or
green
line
to
somerville
depending
where
in
cambridge
you
are
and
where
the
job
is
you
have
a
wealth
of
great
options
at
that
price
point
but
i
would
caution
assuming
that
you
get
a
strictly
turnkey
situation
in
those
towns
most
of
the
housing
stock
around
here
is
quite
old
you
may
be
able
to
find
a
condo
townhouse
at
that
price
with
basically
it
being
all
new
but
anything
new
will
have
some
warts
watch
out
for
flip
jobs
in
the
1mil
1
5mil
range
there
are
a
ton
for
reference
i
bought
recently
in
one
of
those
towns
and
it
cost
900k
for
4
bedrooms
really
2
unless
your
family
consists
of
people
who
are
and
will
be
under
5
6
and
there
s
been
probably
150k
worth
of
repairs
when
we
looked
at
going
above
that
budget
i
think
we
estimated
repairs
deferred
maintenance
would
put
us
50k
in
the
hole
on
top
of
the
sale
price
finally
someone
who
isn
t
delusional
and
has
over
1
million
dollars
you
d
fit
right
at
home
with
eastern
mass
belmont
s
basically
right
between
watertown
and
somerville
and
might
be
what
you
re
looking
for
you
might
also
consider
west
cambridge
take
a
look
at
fresh
pond
maybe
and
explore
outward
from
there
i
d
look
for
a
place
to
rent
anywhere
nearby
then
explore
the
surrounding
towns
neighborhoods
to
get
a
feel
for
where
you
d
like
to
buy
a
budget
of
1m
1
4m
should
give
you
a
number
of
options
good
luck
it
sounds
like
the
best
way
to
do
it
would
be
to
buy
a
property
in
ma
and
then
rent
it
out
while
you
re
in
mexico
i
don
t
think
i
can
just
rent
a
place
in
mass
for
6
months
out
of
the
year
and
a
place
in
mexico
for
6
months
you
could
if
you
are
in
an
apartment
complex
i
know
someone
who
would
always
be
out
4
months
of
the
year
of
their
apartment
that
was
my
favorite
neighbor
you
will
need
to
pay
for
that
time
though
so
if
that
s
not
possible
then
it
s
unlikely
to
be
worthwhile
sadly
otherwise
there
are
quite
a
few
trailer
parks
and
if
you
re
ok
with
living
in
western
massachusetts
or
in
rural
parts
of
other
new
england
states
you
could
swing
it
also
worth
mentioning
that
ri
is
cheaper
i
know
you
said
you
re
old
but
i
don
t
know
how
old
you
are
do
you
need
assistance
to
get
places
do
you
need
access
to
certain
specific
healthcare
all
of
that
may
impact
any
suggestions
here
there
are
seasonal
communities
in
ma
that
may
offer
what
you
need
something
like
https
www
summervillage
org
default
php
https
www
summervillage
org
default
php
edit
there
are
a
lot
of
trans
groups
but
they
tend
to
be
kind
of
localized
so
it
depends
where
you
end
up
something
like
https
www
masstpc
org
https
www
masstpc
org
might
be
able
to
point
you
in
the
direction
of
what
you
need
thanks
so
much
this
is
incredibly
useful
really
appreciate
your
advice
definitely
makes
sense
to
try
to
stay
north
of
the
river
for
us
since
our
child
will
be
going
to
a
bilingual
school
near
watertown
i
think
we
are
okay
with
a
house
that
needs
some
repairs
as
long
as
it
s
nothing
too
major
we
definitely
prefer
sfh
so
are
willing
to
compromise
there
qq
are
there
any
particular
walkable
bikeable
neighborhoods
north
of
charles
that
you
recommend
for
families
just
some
parks
and
restaurants
would
be
great
also
if
you
feel
comfortable
sharing
via
message
any
good
realtors
you
used
i
don
t
have
that
much
money
can
t
buy
a
place
in
ma
and
mexico
is
western
mass
ok
fun
stuff
nice
people
or
is
like
here
in
nc
where
the
rednecks
run
the
rural
and
we
have
real
methlab
problems
in
the
state
if
you
re
looking
for
decent
walkability
basically
any
town
within
i
95
will
have
it
just
in
specific
neighborhoods
of
those
towns
those
locations
will
obviously
have
higher
property
values
my
recommendation
is
for
you
to
check
out
the
following
neighborhoods
arlington
heights
east
arlington
west
medford
medford
square
east
watertown
watertown
center
waverley
neighborhood
in
belmont
belmont
center
most
of
the
neighborhoods
in
newton
are
quite
walkable
so
feel
free
to
check
that
out
too
most
anything
in
cambridge
is
quite
walkable
save
for
west
cambridge
and
i
think
technically
fresh
pond
is
walkable
but
it
s
basically
next
to
a
highway
so
there
s
that
almost
all
of
somerville
is
quite
walkable
so
anything
there
that
isn
t
next
to
assembly
square
unless
you
like
generic
big
box
reatailers
more
outside
of
those
areas
but
still
walkable
malden
winchester
lexington
woburn
melrose
well
at
least
near
the
centers
of
these
towns
also
worth
mentioning
that
each
town
has
different
immigrant
populations
so
depending
on
what
language
your
children
will
be
learning
they
may
get
more
benefit
out
of
being
in
one
town
over
the
other
i
can
t
speak
too
much
without
knowing
the
language
but
definitely
google
around
and
check
stats
on
what
immigrants
have
set
up
roots
in
the
town
watertown
for
example
is
famous
for
their
armenian
population
newton
has
a
high
east
asian
population
etc
regarding
realtors
we
didn
t
find
any
that
were
particularly
good
the
housing
market
is
insane
not
sf
insane
but
any
half
decent
house
will
be
off
the
market
within
a
few
days
at
most
if
not
the
same
day
the
realtors
here
generally
expect
you
to
do
the
research
yourself
and
then
just
bring
them
in
when
you
want
to
make
an
offer
if
you
plan
on
moving
here
first
and
renting
take
the
time
to
visit
each
one
of
the
towns
neighborhoods
and
spend
half
a
day
there
park
somewhere
that
looks
residential
if
allowed
then
go
walk
with
your
family
to
a
local
park
then
grab
a
bite
to
eat
and
then
walk
around
a
bit
more
and
then
head
back
it
s
the
closest
you
ll
get
to
the
experience
of
living
in
those
towns
imo
if
you
re
lucky
some
townie
might
be
willing
to
entertain
a
chat
if
you
introduce
yourself
as
an
out
of
stater
but
good
luck
how
about
a
seasonal

i
know
a
few
snowbirds
that
do

instead

the

is
that

enough
almost
everything
else
is
becoming

and
new

we

just

it

last
i
heard
there
s

i
think
a

of
it
is

state
the

in

we
can
t
point
to

and
say
see
it
works
there
france
is
heavily
regulated
and
here
we
have
lobbyists
that
put
profits
over
safety
i
find
it
humorous
that
the
state
that
experienced
the
worst
industrial
nuclear
accident
in
usa
history
has
no
restrictions
as
though
the

based

of

be
summed
up
by
either
requiring

require
legislative

for

in

case
of

we
are
not
the

but
we
have
the
most
stringent
moratorium
on
it
that
isn
t
technically
a
ban
to
bypass
it
you
need
a
popular
vote
in
a

legislative
approval
a

facility
and
a
few
other
things
we
made
it
mad
hard
i
don
t
know
when
we
placed
the
restrictions
on
it
i
have
2
theories
as
to
why
for
purely
ma
reasons
1
pilgrim
did
cause
some
problems
with
the
bay
2
in
2011
the
nrc
did
a
revamping
of
earthquake
threats
to
reactors
pilgrim
was
2
on
that
list
and
had
an
increase
of
like
700
danger
over
estimates
from
the
80s
it
was
still
like
1
14
000
but
the
point
remains
i
would
guess
we
probably
put
the
restrictions
up
before
the
earthquake
report
but
i
m
not
certain
and
there
are
always
chances
of
concerns
outside
the
commonwealth
led
to
the
legislation
personally
i
like
nuclear
i
think
nuclear
has
come
a
long
way
it
s
the
last
50
years
i
would
even
argue
that
three
mile
island
is
an
example
of
nuclear
done
well
and
not
the
half
assed
soviet
style
reactors
of
chernobyl
i
do
see
merit
on
making
sure
there
s
a
proper
waste
facility
can
we
actually
count
yucca
when
it
is
isn
t
is
isn
t
and
it
s

bounces
around
i
don
t
have
an
immediate
problem
with
legislative
approval
but
that
and
a
general
election
vote
do
seem
onerous
i
think
we
could
stand
to
streamline
the
legislation
to
better
allow
modern
construction
but
also
make
sure
it
had
an
appropriately
short
leash
to
make
sure
no
corners
are
cut
i
think
some
of
the
reasonable
arguments
i
heard
was
that
climate
change
had
been
causing
an
increased
risk
of
natural
disasters
particularly
on
coastline
facing
states
and
that
could
be
dangerous
if
a
nuclear
facility
is
affected

at

all
those

have

i
can
t
speak

the

outlawing
it
but
i
can
speak
to

nuclear
shutting
down
as
my
grandma
lives
around
there
it
was
old
as
dirt
and
the
requirements
costs
to
actually
keep
it
open
outweighed
the
benefits
of
the
energy
it
produced
also
during
a
few
rainstorms
a
few
years
back
they
consistently
ran
drills
of
the
emergency
alarms
so
i
guess
they
were
worried
about
maybe
a
possible
meltdown
although
take
that
with
a
grain
of
salt
as
this
was
years
ago
and
i
haven
t
been
down
there
in

not

elsewise
not

really

what

you

we

to

those

i

fears
about

fears

there

that
s

the

is
a

it
s
not
a

it
s
a
horrible
evil
substance
that
lasts
forever
and
needs
to
be
dealt

that
s
why
we
don

why
we

we

the

let

it
s
silly
the
guy
who
developed
what
was
generally
used
for
the
longest
time
had
come
up
with
a
different
reactor
design
that
would
use
up
more
of

what
we

was
the
cheaper

yes
they

supposed
to
be
some
question
about
the
geology
in
it
i
looked
it
up
a
little
bit
back
everybody
thinks
getting
carbon
out
of
the
air
is
a
good
thing
regardless
of
your
climate
change
position
nuclear
solves
the
problem
today
basically
i
know
p
phasing
out
gas
and
all
that
the
point
is
everybody
talks
about
going
electric
but
we
re
not
making
enough
to
do
what
they
want
and
we
seem
hesitant
to
do
what
we
know
we
need
to
i
think
it
s
a
small
group
that
only
wants
to
stop
things
without
an
alternative
solution
nuclear
is
the
bridge
to
the
next
thing
be
that
cold
fission
or
zero
point
energy
then
just
to
be
sure
i
looked
it
up
the
united
states
has
been
powering
submarines
and
aircraft
carriers
using
nuclear
energy
since
the
mid
1950s
with
the
first
nuclear
powered
submarine
the
uss
nautilus
being
commissioned
in
1955
and
the
first
nuclear
powered
aircraft
carrier
the
uss
enterprise
being
commissioned
in
1961
marking
the
start
of
the
nuclear
navy
era
if
somebody
knows
different
let
me
know
but
i
ve
not
heard
of
one
of
these
melting
down
yes
i
know
it
s
not
exactly
like
the
navy
would
say
anything
but
if
we
take
them
at
their
word
and
protesters
like
my
mom
for
the
clamshell
alliance
fear
makes
people
do
some
wacky
stuff
seabrook
nh
should
have
had
2
reactors
it
s
obvious
by
which
states
have
bans
that
the
whole
thing
is
political
because
its
massachusetts
deleted
old
outdated
fear
mongering
this
should
be
lifted
on
a
federal
level
nuclear
is
the
best
option
so
far
imo
at
least
in
ri
we
had
the
only
fatality
in
the
country
from
a
nuclear
accident

do
we
still
have
any
plants
in
massachusetts
thought
there
was
one
in
plymouth
wait
does
mit
not
have
a
nuclear
facility
moved
here
from
nebraska
where
we
used
electricity
from
valentine
s
nuclear
plant
about
35
miles
away
the
largest
difference
i
ve
seen
is
my
electric
bill
went
from
180
max
in
30f
weather
to
560
max
in
10f
weather
here
both
states
add
a
green
initiative
charge
for
wind
turbine
and
solar
as
a
tax
and
both
use
coal
for
power
nebraska
uses
it
as
a
supplement
in
case
the
grid
needs
additional
power
which
we
did
every
few
weeks
a
lot
of
fears
and
old
stigmas
of
nuclear
reactors
out
there
but
it
s
very
understandable
though
as
three
mile
island
chernobyl
and
fukushima
are
vividly
in
everyone
s
minds
hawaii
i
understand
very
difficult
to
evacuate
islands
if
something
goes
wrong
i
do
know
rhode
island
had
a
nuclear
accident
in
1964
which
may
be
the
reason
why
they
banned
it
it
resulted
in
the
first
known
civilian
nuclear
worker
death
it
s
the
same
reason
it
was
banned
everywhere
else
love
of
fossil
fuel
money
and
the
associated
deaths
selective
media
coverage
and
dramatization
excellent
example
of
why
democrats
are
called
elitist
they
really
do
believe
they
re
the
smartest
people
in
the
room
even
when
it
s
clear
they
re
not
it
s
their
stubbornness
and
closed
mindedness
that
led
to
their
irrational
fears
of
nuclear
power
and
even
now
when
they
preach
about
climate
change
being
a
existential
issue
they
still
can
t
admit
they
were
wrong
they
should
just
come
clean
and
admit
they
were
wrong
and
we
need
to
go
full
steam
ahead
in
building
nuke
plants
wind
and
solar
will
not
meet
the
expected
demands
for
electricity
we
can
t
go
forward
without
nuclear
it
s
way
better
than
burning
coal
while
nuclear
does
create
some
nasty
waste
it
doesn
t
create
a
lot
coal
creates
a
ton
of
waste
ashes
and
they
have
been
struggling
to
find
a
place
for
them
nuclear
is
the
answer
until
someone
invents
something
similar
looks
like
blue
states
to
me
having
grown
up
and
lived
most
of
my
adult
life
with
the
hanford
nuclear
plant
related
cleanup
in
the
news
every
week
i
m
okay
with
skipping
it
someone
cuts
one
corner
and
it
s
a
problem
for
generations
massachusetts
didn
t
ban
them
it
needs
voter
approval
which
honestly
isn
t
a
bad
thing
they
should
have
that
for
any
mega
project
personally
i
think
nuclear
is
great
and
have
no
problem
with
living
next
to
a
modern
plant
not
some
aging
piece
of
sh
t
constructed
only
20
years
after
they
started
the
making
them
and
it
was
science
in
its
infancy
we
have
over
65
years
now
of
the
science
the
dues
and
the
don
t
we
have
the
internet
now
even
the
piece
of
sh
t
ones
are
honestly
not
that
bad
i
mean
we
have
a
nuclear
power
plant
in
plymouth
don
t
we
the
sirens
all
over
that
part
of
the
cape
have
always
been
ominous
to
me
the
extraordinary
expense
of
building
n
fission
generation
gets
passed
on
rate
payers
a
ban
was
the
only
way
to
stop
the
puc
from
approving
more
crazy
expensive
builds
utility
bills
still
reflect
the
costs
of
partially
completed
plants
that
were
cancelled
before
completion
often
due
to
cost
overruns
another
nail
in
the
coffin
fracking
and
cheap
natural
gas
made
gas
turbines
much
cheaper
than
ns
https
cfs
energy
is
hopefully
the
future
i
feel
like
it
s
less
about
how
safe
nuclear
standards
are
now
and
is
more
about
not
trusting
ceos
to
be
able
to
properly
maintain
those
guidelines
for
the
sake
of
profitezation
example
3
mile
companies
didn
t
care
about
concerns
until
an
amazing
man
whistle
blew
and
made
the
hazards
public
which
if
he
didn
t
pennsylvania
could
have
been
chernobyl
like
obviously
the
petroleum
companies
lobbied
for
it
if
the
media
started
doing
pro
nuclear
journalism
that
journalist
would
be
quickly
fired
or
they
would
lose
tens
of
millions
in
advertising
revenue
people
don
t
trust
money
hungry
corporations
and
corrupt
government
officials
to
put
public
safety
ahead
of
profits
look
i
m
100
for
nuclear
power
but
i
also
100
get
opposition
to
it
nuclear
power
is
very
very
dangerous
when
done
poorly
and
these
people
will
do
it
poorly
if
they
think
they
can
make
an
extra
buck
because
fear
mongering
and
keeping
their
friends
rich
we
want
lower
co2
emissions
no
not
like
that
what
about
cambridge
fusion
systems
being
developed
in
devens
https
cfs
energy
yeah
man
those
states
have
suffered
enough
especially
new
jersey
rimshot
ca
is
probably
the
state
that
would
benefit
the
most
with
nuclear
energy
at
this
point
there
isn
t
anything
wrong
with
nuclear
it
s
the
cleanest
and
best
for
of
energy
it
s
because
nuclear
is
in
its
name
is
why
it
has
a
bad
rep
meanwhile
on
the
border
with
rhode
island
there
is
approximately
15
nuclear
reactors
sitting
in
the
water
as
submarines
and
40
of
connecticut
s
power
from
millstone
connecticut
thankfully
understands
nuclear
energy
and
the
importance
of
it
nimbys
that
and
a
by
is
a
large
area
when
it
comes
to
nuclear
otherwise
just
plain
nimbys
how
about
radiation
pollution
cancer
etc
honestly
the
west
cost
seems
like
a
bad
spot
for
nuke
plants
anyway
they
ve
volcanoes
and
earthquakes
and
their
rivers
are
unreliable
it
s
because
nuclear
power
plants
are
so
efficient
eversource
lobbied
our
gov
to
ban
it
so
they
can
continue
taking
our
money
lobbyists
the
people
with
money
who
would
lose
money
poured
tons
of
money
to
spread
propaganda
or
just
out
right
have
it
banned
so
they
didn
t
lose
their
generational
wealth
and
this
happens
easily
because
the
people
in
charge
get
kick
backs
as
well
the
country
is
fucked
seems
the
cause
is
a
combination
of
fear
and
lack
of
critical
thinking
modern
and
future
reactors
can
be
much
more
safe
and
efficient
than
the
old
ones
and
really
should
be
a
part
of
our
energy
production
mix
we
need
zero
co2
energy
production
asap
and
although
the
watts
produced
will
be
expensive
this
is
the
fastest
way
to
scale
up
a
clean
solution
by
providing
as
much
as
40
to
50
of
our
electricity
for
the
next
hundred
years
if
we
can
get
a
bunch
built
now
1
waste
is
a
problem
that
s
yet
to
be
resolved
2
when
something
goes
wrong
it
can
go
really
really
wrong
really
really
fast
and
people
don
t
like
that
it
makes
sense
for
places
like
ca
hi
or
to
ban
it
one
big
earthquake
or
tsunami
can
cause
a
total
disaster
remember
fukushima
i
am
not
sure
why
it
is
banned
in
ma
and
other
ne
states
though
i
d
assume
it
is
based
on
some
specific
old
like
100
years
old
law
related
to
construction
the
law
that
was
in
effect
before
nuclear
reactors
were
invented
and
before
ma
and
me
were
separated
big
oil
funded
the
entire
scare
campaign
using
the
average
npc
numb
nuts
we
don
t
have
any
way
to
properly
dispose
of
nuclear
waste
and
we
have
no
idea
what
to
do
with
it
also
nuclear
waste
is
radioactive
and
harmful
big
oil
france
has
used
nuclear
power
for
decades
and
it
accounts
for
70
of
power
production
all
this
without
any
significant
problems
fear
mongering
and
nimby
mentality
unfortunately
those
states
are
the
higher
concentration
of
environmental
nutjobs
that
doom
and
gloom
instead
of
research
and
improve
nuclear
is
the
cleanest
and
the
safest
form
on
energy
and
we
have
the
facilities
to
hold
the
waste
without
any
fear
of
environmental
contamination
chernobyl
is
why
people
are
scared
of
it
i
m
not
anti
nuclear
but
i
will
say
in
my
opinion
there
s
very
little
reason
to
go
through
the
very
long
very
expensive
process
of
constructing
a
nuclear
plant
when
we
can
generate
such
massive
amounts
of
wind
energy
comparatively
easily
democrats
want
everyone
to
be
driving
evs
that
are
now
using
super
chargers
you
need
100
kilowatts
for
a
tesla
supercharger
you
think
solar
and
wind
power
will
be
enough
for
a
full
ev
conversion
in
washington
they
are
tearing
down
hydrodams
to
save
a
few
salmon
nuclear
is
inevitable
it
s
primarily
the
fear
mongering
of
a
melt
down
if
something
goes
wrong
legitimately
it
s
one
of
the
cleanest
forms
and
most
efficient
forms
of
energy
and
as
of
late
even
one
of
the
safest
as
a
joke
in
the
simpsons
homer
works
at
a
nuclear
power
plant
and
it
s
realisticly
such
a
safe
environment
that
even
with
a
moron
working
there
it
can
still
be
incredibly
safe
and
maintained
fukushima
two
words
virtue
signaling
that
s
why
massachusetts
politicians
banned
it
people
watched
the
simpsons
opening
and
said
omg
homer
simpson
will
just
throw
nuclear
waste
around
and
mr
burns
is
so
evil
let
s
ban
nuclear

plants
we
need
clean

fire
up

lol
massachusetts
is
one
of
the
few
places
with
plenty
of
water
for
cooling
minimal
risk
of
natural
disasters
and
a
big
population
to
create
some
hefty

i
d
think
it
s
an
ideal
location
for
a

there

unfortunately
nuclear
non
proliferation
treaties
signed
about

also
limit
our
ability
to
recycle

so

here
all
use

very
inefficiently
and
produce
an
outsized

not

that

here
it

we

plymouth
had

it
had
a
near
catastrophe
the
waste
can
kill
millions
for
thousands
of

for
ma
i
m
going
to
guess
it
s
because
eversource
doesn
t
want
to
be
in
the
nuclear
power
business
but
don
t
want
to
be
undercut
by
it
either
so
they
paid
off
state
reps
to
ban
nuclear
i
mean
can
you
imagine
if
people
had
an
option
to
pay
less
than
400

to
keep
their

in

eversource
s
main
shareholders
might
have
to
sell
a
yacht
although
i
am
generally
pro
nuclear
i
saw
in
a
reddit
comment
elsewhere
that
nuclear
materials
are
actually
too
rare
to
use
for
energy
considering
the
medical
applications
and
that
they
will
run
out
eventually
same
as
fossil
fuels
if
this
is
true
solar
etc
are
absolutely
the
way
to
go
instead
nothing
and
propaganda
in
that
order
because
it
s
politically
stylish
water
brained
legislation
fear
mongering
just
like
everything
else
that
doesn
t
fit
the
agenda
some
of
the
dumbest
energy
policy
in
the
country
can
be
found
at
home
in
massachusetts
nothing
is
wrong
with
nuclear
power
it
s
fear
mongering
about
nuclear
meltdowns
even
though
the
us
has
a
ton
of
safety
requirements
for
nuclear
power
plants
that
have
redundant
safety
features
to
prevent
a
total
meltdown
the
fear
stems
from
the
three
mile
island
incident
lobbying
and
fear
mongering
chernobyl
three
mike
island
i
m
in
ma
and
we
have
an
active
plant
right
now
i
think
it
s
for
new
construction
having
worked
for
eversource
formerly
northeast
utilities
aka
western
mass
electric
aka
nstar
i
wouldn
t
want
them
anywhere
near
a
nuclear
power
plant
again
the
incompetence
is
just
astounding
not
to
mention
trying
to
get
everything
into
the
rate
base
as
humanly
possible
if
another
company
maybe
heard
too
many
stories
of
accidents
and
near
melt
downs
it
creates
nuclear
waste
and
nobody
wants
to
store
that
crap
in
their
state
lol
california
is
the
last
state
that
should
be
banning
nuclear
the
liberal
left
killed
it
in
the
70
s
yes
the
liberals
caused
this
global
warming
nightmare
we
have
now
i
didn
t
know
we
banned
it
that
s
dumb
i
swear
this
state
bans
everything
like
good
and
bad
just
ban
it
all
i
m
this
state
the
only
2
things
that
aren
t
banned
are
being
wealthy
and
being
poor
no
in
between
lol
just
goes
to
show
these
people
really
don
t
care
about
solving
climate
change
nearly
as
much
as
they
pretend
it
s
mostly
unfounded
fears
about
meltdowns
unfortunately
nuclear
is
cheap
reliable
and
has
a
very
low
carbon

even
though
we
let

start

in

the
regulations
and
rules
for

in

are
so
stringent
that
we
get
tested
on

yearly
and
if
you
were
nuclear
trained
it
was
quarterly
but
for
some
reason
we
can
t
get
past
3

or
fukushima
cuz
big
oil
and
the

were
funding
the
no

movement
starting
in

s
they
financed
the

fear
after

nice

where
a

to
have

because
of

basically
they
didn

know
how
beneficial
it
was
at
that

as
it
was
around
the

of

a

has
changed

then
obviously

of

chernobly
is
why
the

is

decommissioning
plymouth
nuclear
plant
we
ve
never
moved
a
spent
rod
ever
here
in
minnesota
the
nuclear
plant
in
monticello
a
couple
years
ago
said
they
detected
some
radiation
leaking
into
the
groundwater
and
couldn
t
find
the
source
but
told
us
not
to
worry
because
they
were
monitoring
it
so
there
s
no
place
to
put
the
shit
because
it
s
legitimately
dangerous
for
a
failed
capitalist
state
to
fuck
with
this
shit
reddit
drank
the
radioactive
coolaid
hard
though
we
can
t
keep
the
t
running
properly
can
we
really
maintain
a
nuclear
plant
as
we
can
tell
from
our
lack
of
climate
change
preparations
most
people
are
absolutely
unable
to
understand
cause
and
effect
or
even
just
compare
consequences
of
multiple
options
paths
rare
mass
l
retarded
hippies
thats
why
because
most
people
simply
do
not
think
things
through
see
germany
s
power
mix
right
now
as
an
example
we
can
not
a
continue
to
increase
our
electricity
consumption
b
not
spend
massive
amounts
of
money
and
resources
on
renewables
c
reduce
greenhouse
gas
emissions
and
d
not
build
nuclear
plants
a
similar
phenomenon
exists
with
most
people
s
view
of
healthcare
we
can
bum
off
of
connecticut
s
nuclear
energy
and
let
the
deal
with
the
fallout
if
something
goes
wrong
conservatives
hated
it
they
preferred
coal
and
burning
garbage
nimby
well
we
don

like
cancer
for
one
it
destroys
air
quality
look
at
new
delhi
india
the
air
there
is
so
polluted
people
die
my
answer
to
this
is
the
oil
industry
they
saw
what
happened
to
chernobyl
three
mile
island
and
fukushima
and
instantly
capitalized
on
the
fear
despite
there
being
only
one
simple
solution
protect
the
cooling
system
and
lobbied
politicians
to
pass
restrictions
and
bans
on
nuclear
power
to
drive
more
money
back
to
the
oil
and
gas
industry
in
a
way
big
oil
is
singlehandedly
responsible
for
the
vast
majority
of
environment
and
power
related
issues
plaguing
our
planet
promoting
plastics
oil
spills
destruction
of
marine
habitats
and
air
pollution

a

the

lol
look
which

it
is
those
are
all
occupied
communist
territories
they
don
t
want
you
to
have
reliable
cheap
energy
isn
t
yucca
mountain
famously
empty
because
environmental
lawyers
sued
to
kept
it
from
being
used
not
to
mention
there
s
at
least
one
closed
power
plant
in
state
already
i
lived
not
far
from
the
nuclear
power
plant
in
plymouth
pilgrim
nuclear
power
station
and
it
closed
in
2015
due
to
cost
concerns
it
needed
serious
safety
upgrades
and
i
just
read
that
market
conditions
played
a
role
in
its
closing
probably
our
overreliance
on
fossil
fuels
like
you
mentioned
now
it
ll
take
decades
to
decommission
because
the
radiation
has
to
decay
anyway
it
s
just
sitting
there
doing
nothing
in
the
meantime
people
don
t
care
about
climate
change
i
ve
concluded
the
risks
of
nuclear
are
far
easier
to
imagine
because
we
ve
had
a
lot
of
very
visible
nuclear
accidents
in
the
past
the
risks
of
not
decarbonizing
our
electricity
sector
well
unfortunately
the
results
of
climate
change
are
subtle
enough
to
most
people
that
they
do
not
think
it
s
an
emergency
it
s
just
how
our
minds
operate
acute
risks
matter
far
more
than
slow
moving
ones
i
am
as
pro
nuclear
as
can
be
but
people
are
quite
frankly
uneducated
about
the
issue
and
while
i
think
there
s
a
future
with
fusion
energy
if
that
comes
to
fruition
i
think
nuclear
is
too
much
of
a
third
rail
the
failure
to
clean
up
after
the
pilgrim
nuclear
plant
and
the
constant
requests
to
dump
radioactive
water
directly
into
the
bay
make
it
a
hard
climate
for
nuclear
in
mass
well
the
waste
issue
until
recently
was
a
legit
concern
and
the
source
of
most
of
the
bans
listed
in
the
graphic
it
was
only
recently
that
nuclear
tech
has
advanced
enough
to
use
thorium
the
main
byproduct
of
uranium
reactors
as
a
valid
fuel
source
which
funny
enough
eventually
gives
u233
as
it
s
waste
which
can
in
turn
be
used
in
uranium
based
reactors
they
aren
t
really
unfounded
there
are
two
cities
on
the
planet
that
are
pretty
much
ghost
towns
due
to
nuclear
disasters
chernobyl
was
obviously
much
worse
but
the
ground
water
in
in
fukishima
is
still
being
contaminated
that
said
there
are
new
and
safer
technologies
that
should
not
be
discounted
i
d
rather
see
them
built
in
low
population
areas
first
albeit
we
don
t
actually
have
any
designated
sites
to
dump
waste
and
the
optics
of
proposing
to
do
so
in
a
volcano
doesn
t
help
i
am
not
against
nuclear
power
i
assume
that
most
of
these
unfounded
fears
were
a
result
of
lobbying
from
gas
and
oil
companies
seriously
modern
small
module
reactor
tech
is
just
insanely
advanced
even
moderately
sized
cities
will
be
able
to
easily
maintain
an
smb
on
the
footprint
of
a
modern
supermarket
look
i
m
pro
nuclear
power
but
let
s
not
call
meltdown
fears
unfounded
given
three
mile
island
and
later
chernobyl
the
fears
were
well
founded
with
the
aggressively
anti
regulation
ethos
and
low
bid
cost
cutting
we
saw
and
see
from
every
major
corporation
and
half
the
voters
people
remain
largely
skeptical
this
i
interned
at
a
nuclear
power
plant
as
thermal
engineer
and
given
ma
s
geography
and
not
having
to
worry
about
earthquakes
banning
nuclear
is
a
shortsighted
decision
nuclear
plants
have
much
higher
security
than
airports
on
first
day
i
was
told
not
to
run
anywhere
in
the
plant
or
the
security
will
shoot
without
any
question
modern
reactors
are
much
more
efficient
and
nuclear
comes
as
close
as
it
can
get
to
clean
energy
a
single
nuclear
plant
can
serve
multiple
cities
and
even
half
a
state
germany
banned
nuclear
in
a
hurry
and
now
they
re
questioning
that
decision
and
looking
to
restart
their
plants
if
ma
wants
cheap
clean
electricity
nuclear
should
be
an
option
yeah
those
people
in
chernobyl
are
so
exaggerated
unfounded
fears
i
like
that
unfounded
fears
it
s
only
a
matter
of
time
and
it
s
just
that
only
a
matter
of
time
than
no
matter
how
well
something
is
controlled
it
will
fuck
up
now
let
s
put
into
that
recipe
built
in
fuckups
and
less
than
stellar
oversight
all
the
time
when
a
meltdown
happens
it
s
not
a
matter
of
saying
oh
i
m
sorry
and
let
s
get
fema
in
there
right
away
clean
it
up
get
everybody
fed
rehosed
and
get
emergency
funding
in
there
even
in
the
billions
and
rebuild
it
it
s
fucked
and
the
land
is
gone
did
you
miss
that
part
it
becomes
a
chernobyl
no
matter
how
careful
you
are
sooner
or
later
will
happen
yeah
yeah
we
re
all
going
to
die
in
the
world
is
going
to
be
hit
by
an
asteroid
but
let
s
just
stack
the
cards
in
our
favor
in
the
meantime
burn
what
s
the
waste
product
from
that
i
wouldn
t
say
fears
are
unfounded
and
not
because
nuclear
is
inherently
dangerous
i
m
fearful
of
nuclear
because
catastrophic
failure
is
well
catastrophic
and
in
the
hands
of
unfettered
unregulated
capitalism
catastrophic
failure
will
just
be
another
inevitable
cost
on
the
way
to
making
billions
high
construction
costs
public
concerns
about
safety
following
major
accidents
like
three
mile
island
and
fukushima
uncertainty
regarding
spent
nuclear
waste
disposal
yes
modern
technology
hasn
t
solved
this
and
the
increasing
availability
of
cheaper
renewable
energy
sources
making
it
less
economically
viable
to
build
new
nuclear
plants
compared
to
other
options
in
many
regions
write
to
your
governors
california
or
the
coasts
in
general
are
probably
good
calls
you
don
t
want
them
near
earthquake
prone
places
nor
places
with
severe
weather
hurricanes
this
is
it
a
lot
of
stupid
people
convinced
the
populous
nuclear
is
bad
there
are
no
production
thorium
reactors
up
and
running
yet
i
agree
laws
should
be
updated
to
allow
them
as
their
risk
of
catastrophe
is
quite
low
but
that
older
generation
it
s
pretty
reasonable
to
conclude
that
the
risks
are
high
and
the
consequences
of
mismanagement
and
meltdown
are
unacceptably
high
for
what
it
s
worth
i
feel
the
same
way
about
coal
plants
and
their
output
as
well
every
penny
of
new
built
energy
needs
to
be
optimized
to
where
we
want
to
be
in
20
years
solar
wind
hydro
geo
thorium
and

should
be
our

with

on
the

if
it

something
else
people
wouldn
t
be
so
afraid
of
it
but
it

a
similar

to

thorium

where
do
we
put
the
radioactive
rocks
i
don
t
think
it
s
there
are
unfounded
concerns
about
what
to
do
with
waste
the
company
who
bought
the
site
in
plymouth
wants
to
release
the
waste
into
plymouth
bay
it
s
fossil
fuels
they
pay
politicians
to
pretend
it
s
bad
and
convince
everyone
it
s
scary
if
you
environmentalists
really
care
about
emissions
do
something
about
india
first
they
are
the
worst
polluters
in
the
world
and
that
is
a
fact
put
is
somewhere
geographically
stable
and
preferably
a
lower
population
density
at
a
minimum
it
s
carbon
free
except
for
all
the
energy
that
has
to
be
used
to
produce
uranium
unfounded
fears
lol
also
with
a
deeply
ironic
assist
by
greenpeace
and
other
environmental
organizations
who
inadvertently
encouraged
increased
coal
burning
it
s
not
just
fossil
fuel
companies
pushing
the
fear
good
use
of
astroturfing
because
you
know
rubber
and
fossil
fuels
is
waste
disposal
not
longer
a
legit
concern
the
biggest
problem
i
have
with
this
is
the
waste
disposal
section
very
often
radioactive
waste
is
stored
on
site
at
nuclear
power
plants
so
the
requirement
that
a
dedicated
facility
already
exist
is
prohibitive
think
of
it
as
chicken
and
egg
you
can
t
build
a
power
plant
if
there
isn
t
a
waste
disposal
site
but
there
isn
t
going
to
be
a
waste
disposal
site
if
the
plant
isn
t
built
seabrook
has
been
running
for
half
a
century
what
do
they
do
with
their
waste
disposal
and
long
term
maintenance
when
you
let
private
companies
run
these
things
their
goal
is
profit
maximization
and
therefore
tend
to
cut
corners
when
it
comes
to
investing
in
the
long
term
maintenance
of
their
facilities
the
tritium
leak
up
in
vermont
did
not
help
this
there
are
other
environmental
concerns
as
well
the
cooking
water
from
pilgrim
nps
on
the
cape
cod
bay
was
warm
enough
that
it
raised
the
temperature
of
the
entire
bay
which
is
quite
detrimental
to
the
fishing
industries
and
marine
ecology
in
that
area
you
re
spot
on
here
i
ve
always
wondered
how
people
can
be
so
dead
set
on
offshore
wind
and
solar
farms
which
require
major
disruption
to
large
uninhabited
areas
in
order
to
keep
up
with
demand
while
also
claiming
that
nuclear
will
be
too
dangerous
and
disruptive
it
just
comes
across
as
dishonest
and
disingenuous
it
s
only
a
matter
of
time
before
nuclear
energy
bans
are
lifted
i
m
sure
most
of
the
population
here
would
likely
vote
for
the
ban
to
be
repealed
but
i
m
sure
there
s
legal
pressure
being
put
on
by
companies
like
eversource
that
want
to
keep
heating
everyone
s
houses
with
natural
gas
and
charging
a
fortune
for
it
yeah
the
60s
70s
when
the
plant
was
being
built
were
a
bit
of
a
wild
west
era
for
nuclear
modern
reactors
are
much
safer
but
it
s
all
perfectly
safe
waste
source
trust
me
bro
and
my
corporate
energy
industry
funded
sources
mostly
this
no
where
in
state
would
be
out
of
a
fallout
zone
not
in
my
backyard
as
they
say
yeah
i
mean
i
don
t
like
it
but
i
get
it
same
with
california
shits
got
some
crazy
weather
that
you
don

want

rushmore
beef

soy

as
a

a

at
risk
thankfully
new
reactors
do
not
have
this
problem
with
correct
safeguards
even
the
50s
era
chernobyl
had
a
safeguard
but
the
commies
overruled
it

which
recent

killed

they
also
seem
to

that
absolutely
nobody
ever
fucks
up
and
no
company
ever
skimps
on
safety
systems
and
no
governments
ever
decide
to
rollback
safety
regulations
in
the
name
of
economics
i
would
even
argue
that
three
mile
island
is
an
example
of
nuclear
done
well
lol
the
concern
there
is
a
loss
of
offsite
power
situation
downed
power
cables
etc
causing
critical
systems
to
shut
down
it
s
a
reasonable
concern
but
one
that
a
lot
of
smart
people
have
been
working
on
so
i
have
a
feeling
this
will
become
less
of
a
barrier
throwback
to
the
atomic
age
it
s
not
even

there
are
so
many
other

even

are
fighting
against
it
it
s
stupid
oil
isn

going
anywhere
even
with

that

you

you

we
can
do
it
we
just
don
t
want
to
spend
the
effort
and
money
to
put
that
kind
of
infrastructure
in
place
how
many
people
have
been
killed
by
nuclear
power
waits
okay
now
how
many
people
have
died
from
coal
how
about
oil
okay
now
wind
you
have
to
look
at
the
data
people
there
s
still
an
operating
nuclear
plant
in
california
i
used
to
live
a
few
miles
from
it
it
s
right
on
the
coast
ironically
directly
on
a
fault
line
it
was
supposed
to
be
closed
and
decommissioned
stupid
idea
but
that
was
surprisingly
vetoed
by
the
governor
a
very
nice
surprise
local
residents
overwhelmingly
wanted
it
to
remain
open
it
makes
sense
it
s
clean
reliable
energy
that
ll
last
for
decades
to
come
anyone
who
argues
against
it
i
have
to
assume
is
disingenuous
about
their
climate
change
position
and
they
dumped
that
same
water
from
the
same
place
in
the
reactor
at
much
higher
activity
concentrations
for
the
entire
operation
of
the
plant
the
effluent
releases
post
operation
would
have
been
substantially
less
radioactive
all
this
information
is
public
the
population
around
plymouth
gave
into
the
fear
mongering
all
this
is
going
to
do
is
result
in
more
cost
to
taxpayers
and
ironically
a
higher
chance
of
economic
impacts
as
the
protesters
and
press
brought
more
attention
to
a
non
issue
please
watch
or
read
the
minutes
from
the
public
panel
from
9
25
23
the
nrc
gave
a
presentation
with
data
from
the
required
annual
effluent
release
reports
of
the
plant
the
final
bill
was
23
billion
over
the
initial
budget
you
could
invent
a
new
battery
technology
for
grid
storage
with
that
amount
of
money
you
mean
has
caused
customers
to
pay
more
for
the
last
15
years
every
time
ga
power
needed
more
money
for
vogtle
3
4
construction
they
asked
the
public
service
commission
to
raise
rates
now
vogtle
is
open
and
electricity
rates
are
higher
as
a
former
georgia
power
customer
i
can
say
it
is
not
worth
it
nuclear
upfront
cost
is
not
competitive
especially
with
delays
and
overruns
however
once
it
s
operating
nuclear
is
very
economical
due
to
low
fuel
costs
real
engineering
has
a
good

sure
there
are
risks
but
you
must
consider
the
risks
of
the
alternatives
nuclear
is
the
safest
energy
source
period
yes
even
counting
the
three
meltdowns
it
s
even
safer
than
wind
according
to
the
eia
we
re
not
even
most
expensive
in
new
england
ct
and
ri
have
higher
overall
energy
costs
we
are
4th
in
the
country
so
let
s
not
run
to
hyperbole
facts
work
fine
she
also
ran
for
president
in
2019
on
shutting
down
all
of
the
country
s
nuclear
power
plants
now
why
would
they
have
to
do
that
when
nuclear
is
totally
safe
trust
me
bro
but
younger
gens
should
be
able
to
remember
and
continue
to
witness
fukushima
yeah
that
s
totally
the
same
thing
r
iamverysmart
the
future
is
magnets
we
haven
t
even
taken
a
minute
to
consider
the
human
impact
of
people
mining
for
uranium
we
ve
already
seen
with
coal
mines
and
fracking
operations
and
pipeline
failures
that
the
energy
is
pretty
shitty
overall
when
it
comes
to
safety
so
we
think
that
the
people
out
mining
uranium
are
totally
gonna
have
really
good
radiation
protection
because
what
energy
corporations
are
fucking
noble
and
generous
vermont
yankee
no
one
wants
to
talk
about
it
everyone
has
short
term
thinking
exactly
this
country
has
not
proven
that
they
can
handle
dangerous
technology
it
we
haven
t
the
whole
nuclear
industry
needs
to
be
regulated
so
strictly
and
this
country
won
t
allow
it
it
just
won
t
you
can
t
compare
us
to
france
since
they
look
at
france
they
have
it
france
is
regulated
the
shit
out
of
it
regulated
don
t
let
lobbyist
it
don
t
let
republicans
and
democrats
near
it
just
regulated
and
keep
it
strictly
tested
every
single
month
and
not
cut
corners
then
maybe
then
maybe
i
would
say
ok
let
s
go
with
it
but
i
don
t
trust
corporations
i
don
t
trust
the
government
when
it
s
in
the
wrong
hands
to
do
the
right
thing
the
only
time
nuclear
has
gone
really
bad
was
under
a
communist
regime
fukushima
no
reactor
attributed
deaths
after
a
massive
tsunami
hit
and
a
piss
poor
response
three
mile
island
did
nothing
despite
everything
going
wrong
three
biggest
accidents
chernobyl
38
years
ago
a
flawed
design
run
by
deliberately
uninformed
and
poorly
trained
operators
overseen
by
a
notoriously
corrupt
communist
regime
fukushima
13
years
ago
built
on
a
fault
line
in
one
of
the
most
tsunami
prone
areas
on
earth
three
mile
island
45
years
ago
the
result
of
operator
error
and
faulty
procedures
little
to
no
significant
impact
of
the
disaster
since
it
was
mostly
contained
the
worst
damage
it
did
was
to
nuclear
s
public
reputation
please
note
how
long
ago
these
occurred
an
one
yellow
animated
tv
show
my
little
brother
had
lots
of
meltdowns
but
i
still
love
him
alll
the
nuclear
waste
in
the
us
is
still
on
site
at
the
facility
and
now
it
can
be
recycled
if
that
was
allowed
yeah
we
care
about
people
not
being
irradiated
here
california
has
nuclear
power
this
isn
t
remotely
true
you
could
actually
do
your
homework
before
posting
something
so
wrong
my
fear
is
a
for
profit
private
company
will
run
it
so
cheaply
that
problems
will
happen
and
we
the
citizens
will
pay
for
the
problems
with
our
money
and
lives
i
m
not
sure
about
mit
but
umass
lowell
has
one
everyone
ridicules
the
toyota
ceo
who
has
been
so
cranky
against
the
grain
but
he
likes
hybrids
that
use
some
fossil
fuels
to
recharge
and
even
fuel
cells
whatever
i
think
corporations
have
latched
onto
electrification
in
ways
that
will
now
follow
through
when
more
nuance
and
restraint
would
be
better
i
m
no
luddite
but
prioritizing
and
triaging
is
called
for
for
example
warehouse
labor
instead
of
a
robotic
warehouse
can
save
energy
without
polluting
but
a
coal
plant
replaced
by
a
wind
farm
is
high
priority
obviously
and
bitcoin
mining
is
so
f
ed
up
it
s
beyond
words
almost
all
financial
transactions
are
electric
now
as
it
is
but
we
are
taking
it
to
the
hilt
as
to
electric
use
it
s
not
fear
mongering
you
know
it
s
about
regulations
france
can
do
it
because
they
regulate
the
crap
out
of
that
industry
here
we
would
get
lobbyists
that
only
care
about
profit
over
people
this
country
has
to
prove
that
it
cares
more
about
the
people
and
that
hasn
t
been
the
case
for
decades
yes
i
too
get
my
solid
information
about
the
safety
of
radioactive
nuclear
science
from
cartoons
jesus
christ
on
a
graphite
control
rod
by
the
way
the
power
plant
in
the
simpsons
was
literally
based
on
the
trojan
reactor
in
oregon
after
16
years
of
irregular
service
the
plant
was
closed
permanently
in
1992
by
its
operator
portland
general
electric
after
cracks
were
discovered
in
the
steam
generator
tubing
perfectly
safe
bro
trust
my
energy
industry
sources
bro
ah
yes
well
if
the
simpsons
said
it
s
a
safe
environment
then
s
but
the
us
is
not
japan
the
most
poisonous
fuels
in
the
world
they
re
actually
far
less
poisonous
than
a
lot
of
other
industrial
substances
what
they
are
that
makes
things
challenging
long
term
is
lingering
the
short
term
challenge
is
that
simply
turning
them
off
doesn
t
stop
the
heat
production
decay
heat
only
ramps
down
over
time
so
you
have
to
have
a
failsafe
way
to
keep
removing
that
heat
until
the
decay
activity
slows
down
that
also
means
that
you
need
a
way
to
keep
supplying
them
with
electric
power
to
run
those
coolant
pumps
and
backup
pumps
which
they
cannot
themselves
power
once
turned
off
in
chain
reaction
and
power
generation
sense
i
agree
i
don
t
trust
our
government
and
i
don
t
trust
corporations
to
do
the
right
thing
you
know
republicans
hate
regulating
anything
and
corporations
only
care
about
their
bottom
line
they
will
cut
costs
to
make
profit
and
they
don
t
care
about
the
safety
of
people
they
have
proven
it
time
and
time
again
when
they
re
not
regulated
that
they
don
t
care
and
i
don
t
trust
republicans
and
lobbyist
to
take
something
that
may
be
heavily
regulated
and
and
then
deregulate
it
corporations
and
their
government
have
to
prove
themselves
to
us
that
they
can
be
trusted
with
this
and
they
just
can
t
they
have
not
proven
this
i
mean
this
goes
back
to
like
healthcare
insurance
and
it
being
for
profit
and
the
guy
who
shot
that
ceo
and
nobody
gave
a
shit
about
that
ceo
it
s
because
corporations
will
do
anything
for
the
bottom
line
for
their
shareholders
and
they
don
t
give
a
shit
about
the
average
american
this
idk
why
every
comment
is
so
pro
nuclear
i
m
genuinely
mystified
this
happened
45
years
ago
and
was
the
result
of
a
combination
of
operator
error
and
faulty
procedures
the
industry
has
come
a
long
way
since
then
so
much
so
that
three
mile
island
is
actually
set
to
reopen
errrrr
no
just
no
born
and
raised
40
years
in
plymouth
never
heard
of
any
near
catastrophe
please
do
tell
we
have
a
nuclear
power
plant
near
where
i
live
it
was
built
in
1971
and
is
still
fully
operational
it
provides
power
to
2
million
people
nuclear
power
is
great
if
built
correctly
and
the
upkeep
is
done
regularly
dont
let
the
fear
mongering
get
to
you
eversource
doesn
t
sell
electricity
they
just
own
the
power
lines
and
transmission
equipment
they
don
t
care
if
the
electricity
is
from
nuclear
solar
coal
or
whatever
uranium
is
incredibly
abundant
so
we
might
run
out
when
the
earth
is
absorbed
by
the
sun
their
fault
lines
would
beg
to
differ
lol
yeah
it
definitely
wasn
t
the
multi
trillion
dollar
fossil
fuel
industries
that
did
it
just
you
know
liberals
cause
reasons
too
bad
you
got
downvoted
i
was
hopeful
nuclear
is
literally
the
safest
per
kilowatt
hour
it
s
the
70
s
and
80
s
not
the
50s
that
folks
remember
people
still
can
t
go
near
chernobyl
38
years
later
this
is
why
we
have
regulations
and
testing
i
m
not
for
banning
anything
as
we
should
have
everything
on
the
table
to
potential
use
energy
is
never
a
one
size
fits
all
i
don
t
fault
any
nimby
folks
for
nuclear
i
grew
up
in
zion
il
right
next
to
one
of
the
larger
plants
in
the
us
very
safe
but
was
a
major
drain
on
the
city
as
people
didn
t
want
to
live
near
it
it
really
didn
t
employ
that
many
people
and
the
town
was
depressed
from
growth
due
to
the
stacks
looming
right
over
us
we
had
to
do
drills
yearly
and
evacuate
30
miles
away
in
45
mins
on
a
plus
side
the
water
in
lake
michigan
was
always
warmer
and
cleaner
the
epa
was
out
there
daily
monitoring
we
went
swimming
there
all
the
time
we
knew
if
the
epa
guys
were
there
and
not
running
we
were
safe
this
was
in
the
80
s
so
both
3
miles
away
island
and
chernobyl
were
very
fresh
in
folks
minds
moron
you
dont
get
cancer
from
nuclear
power
plants
can
you
site
some
reasons
you
think
this
you
do
know
all
that
smoke
coming
from
nuclear
plants
is
just
steam
right
it
s
one
of
the
cleanest
sources
of
energy
we
have
yes
it
was
completed
but
never
opened
i
recall
ymp
being
shelved
by
obama
as
soon
as
he
came
in
i
assume
it
was
for
senator
harry
reid
i
think
neighboring
states
were
also
a
challenge
in
shipping
the
selection
of
nv
in
the
late
80s
might
have
flown
until
enough
ca
folks
moved
there
by
the
2000s
to
make
it
very
unpopular
it
was
supposed
to
be
a
natural
barrier
system
but
by
the
end
the
casks
were
ni
alloys
with
ti
drip
shields
over
them
you
could
build
it
in
just
about
any
remote
place
then
no
harry
reid
killed
it
thanks
for
the
clarification
my
wife
reminded
me
that
she
told
me
that
2
years
ago
and
i
of
course
promptly
forgot
the
waste
is
actually
stored
on
site
at
the
various
reactors
did
they
have
a
problem
with
the
yucca
mountain
location
or
design
in
particular
or
were
they
just
mad
about
a
nuclear
waste
storage
facility
since
they
thought
it
would
encourage
nuclear
waste
environmental
lawyers
paid
for
with
oil
money
there
s
at
least
one
closed
power
plant
in
state
already
at
least
two
yankee
rowe
vermont
yankee
was
a
short
bike
ride
up
the
river
from
ma
a
river
which
flows
south
of
course
seabrook
is
just
two
miles
across
the
line
in
nh
and
still
operating
many
of
the
closures
were
economic
in
the
moment
of
the
decision
but
against
a
backdrop
of
ongoing
disputes
over
safety
policy
what
people
aren
t
aware
of
either
is
mit
actually
has
a
working
reactor
as
well
on
campus
for
education
purposes
they
just
don
t
have
any
nuclear
material
on
hand
to
use
yankee
rowe
nuclear
power
station
out
in
the
berkshires
is
another
decommissioned
plant
in
the
state
the
first
commercial
nuclear
power
plant
in
new
england
although
it
s
been
fully
decommissioned
since
2007
the
risks
of
nuclear
are
far
easier
to
imagine
because
we
ve
had
a
lot
of
very
visible
nuclear
accidents
in
the
past
yeah
3
mile
island
and
chernobyl
not
that
either
could
happen
today
but
people
are
obsessed
with
them
exxon
valdez
doesn
t
have
quite
the
same
impact
as
those
it
s
being
built
where
there
is
less
resistance
georgia
just
finished
one
didn
t
it
i
think
it
was
over
budget
though
which
is
another
issue
i
m
no
fan
of
nuclear
but
recognize
that
if
we
don
t
address
it
in
another
way
we
may
feel
forced
to
use
more
of
it
edit
never
been
so
happy
to
be
downvoted
why
don
t
we
rebrand
it
as
fission
since
it
s
more
specific
than
nuclear
once
fusion
becomes
a
thing
lest
people
catch
on
that
fusion
is
also
nuclear
and
we
start
having
issues
because
of
it
i
agree
and
find
it
disturbing
to
hear
that
revisionist
claim
that
concerns
were
unfounded
promote
nuclear
fair
and
square
especially
if
you
want
to
be
persuasive
wait
we
can
use
uranium
in
reactors
and
end
up
with
thorium
as
waste
then
use
that
waste
in
another
reactor
and
end
up
with
uranium
again
to
be
used
again
this
can
t
be
right
what
am
i
missing
a
lot
of
people
don
t
realize
that
most
nuclear
waste
just
sits
there
they
store
it
in
dry
casks
on
site
or
in
cooling
tanks
there
isn
t
really
a
good
national
waste
storage
strategy
while
the
new
generation
of
reactors
are
great
we
do
still
need
to
figure
out
what
to
do
with
the
waste
current
strategy
of
making
it
tomorrow
s
problem
just
isn
t
a
good
idea
you
re
just
echoing
more
of
the
uninformed
anti
nuclear
propaganda
you
ve
been
fed
it
s
not
your
fault
for
being
uninformed
many
people
are
and
that
s
by
design
by
energy
companies
people
don
t
understand
was
little
nuclear
waste
is
produced
uranium
is
so
energy
dense
people
have
no
idea
let
me
break
it
down
1kg
of
coal
produces
8kwh
of
heat
1kg
of
oil
produces
12kwh
of
heat
1kg
of
uranium
235
can
produce
24
000
000kwh
do
you
understand
the
waste
issue
was
never
a
real
problem
it
was
brainwashed
environmental
groups
being
fed
propaganda
by
big
oil
to
make
nuclear
bad
pushing
the
issue
the
us
has
about
90
000
tons
of
waste
spent
fuel
that
could
be
re
enriched
in
some
cases
that
s
it
to
put
it
into
perspective
the
us
consumed
815
billion
tons
of
oil
last
year
alone
so
burying
fuel
in
dry
casks
is
a
legit
storage
option
that
offered
little
environmental
risk
significantly
less
environment
risk
than
burning
815
billion
tons
of
oil
each
year
about
twenty
years
ago
i
learned
that
nuclear
isn
t
a
viable
long
term
solution
until
fusion
works
because
we
don
t
have
anywhere
near
the
amount
of
uranium
to
replace
the
world
s
energy
needs
for
a
significant
amount
of
time
is
this
no
longer
true
with
newer
nuclear
tech
they
were
all
legit
concerns
this
isn
t
strictly
true
the
earliest
thorium
research
reactor
lwbr
was
built
in
1977
the
us
canned
research
into
it
until
1999
because
it
wasn
t
considered
efficient
enough
compared
to
uranium
despite
having
no
waste
the
two
examples
that
you
ve
given
though
were
caused
by
1
a
design
flaw
combined
with
human
error
and
2
literally
2
acts
of
god
9
0
earthquake
and
tsunami
the
design
used
for
chernobyl
hasn
t
been
used
in
the
us
and
i
don
t
think
it
was
used
outside
of
the
soviet
union
to
begin
with
and
the
level
of
incompetence
at
running
a
nuclear
reactor
is
generally
avoided
here
as
well
fukushima
arguably
could
have
withstood
one
natural
disaster
two
major
disasters
hitting
so
close
together
is
incredibly
rare
and
outside
of
what
nearly
any
piece
of
infrastructure
is
designed
for
i
m
not
sure
how
much
of
the
experience
of
the
us
navy
translates
to
civilian
reactors
but
any
organization
with
a
basically
perfect
safety
record
should
be
someone
everyone
looks
to
build
them
in
low
population
areas
and
you
ll
get
crappy
people
working
there
since
you
ll
need
to
require
good
people
to
relocate
build
them
in
populated
areas
and
you
ll
get
to
pick
and
choose
from
the
best
pool
of
candidates
three
mile
island
the
worst
nuclear
disaster
in
the
western
hemisphere
released
less
radiation
than
a
standard
chest
x
ray
chernobyl
idiotic
russians
already
using
a
bad
reactor
design
which
is
not
in
use
anywhere
in
the
us
intentionally
disabled
all
their
safety
systems
and
backups
to
run
a
test
on
the
system
with
their
least
experienced
shift
of
operators
yeah
i
don
t
understand
this
we
live
in
the
united
states
the
land
where
deregulation
is
like
republicans
mantra
and
we
can
t
seem
to
get
them
off
that
mantra
and
lobbyists
are
king
and
it
doesn
t
matter
if
you
re
democrat
or
republican
you
can
pay
off
democrats
too
this
is
one
area
where
i
m
gonna
say
nope
france
can
do
it
cause
they
re
heavily
regulated
very
regulated
they
can
t
scratch
their
ass
because
they
re
so
regulated
in
america
nope
corporations
and
our
government
have
to
prove
to
the
people
that
they
can
be
trusted
with
this
and
you
know
what
they
can
t
even
handle
healthcare
for
crying
out
loud
and
any
other
people
here
are
saying
let
s
go
nuclear
let
s
go
nuclear
until
somebody
wants
to
build
it
in
their
backyard
and
then
they
re
gonna
say
no
that
s
not
necessarily
true
it
s
an
engineering
problem
to
build
in
enough
fail
safes
it
s
a
management
problem
to
get
good
people
just
problems
with
answers
like
everything
else
so
you
would
rather
we
build
more
oil
platforms
that
will
create
total
dead
zones
in
the
ocean
when
they
fail
fossil
fuels
are
already
having
much
more
ruinous
and
far
reaching
consequences
chernobyl
jesus
god
imagine
if
everyone
pointed
to
the
tenerife
airport
disaster
and
said
you
know
what
no
more
airplanes
we
are
all
set
now
let
s
just
stick
ground
travel
or
if
after
caveman
grug
burned
up
his
sleeping
bag
and
all
of
his
fellow
neanderthals
said
uh
oh
fire
bad
and
stopped
using
fire
completely
asinine
three
mile
island
failed
in
the
best
possible
way
the
reactor
was
destroyed
but
the
damage
was
contained
and
the
release
of
radiation
was
minimal
fukushima
was
a
black
swan
event
involving
a
tsunami
and
poor
management
chernobyl
was
the
result
of
a
terrible
reactor
design
that
should
never
have
been
deployed
make
of
those
what
you
will
no
the
issues
aren
t
imaginary
nimby
lots
of
wealthy
residents
can
lawyer
up
if
needed
i
think
it
s
just
basic
scientific
illiteracy
to
this
day
myths
like
sugar
makes
kids
hyperactive
persist
so
what
hope
do
we
have
communicating
an
abstract
concept
like
expectation
value
of
health
impairment
over
a
huge
sample
space
when
people
naturally
reason
in
anecdotes
and
the
field
of
nuclear
power
has
1
2
huge
but
exceedingly
rare
anecdotes
it
s
the
same
reason
people
have
fear
of
flying
even
when
the
most
dangerous
part
of
flying
is
the
drive
to
the
airport
thanks
this
made
me
smile
with
thorium
based
reactors
being
a
thing
it
isn
t
as
bad
of
a
concern
with
the
recent
research
into
the
thorium
fuel
cycle
it
was
never
a
legitimate
concern
coal
ash
is
significantly
more
dangerous
and
there
are
basically
no
rules
around
how
it
s
stored
it
s
not
an
insolvable
problem
there
is
an
answer
to
the
question
can
the
waste
be
stored
and
if
so
where
and
the
question
can
be
answered
by
a
competent
department
of
energy
one
of
the
ones
on
the
chopping
block
because
someone
claims
to
have
a
big
eh
brain
i
grew
up
the
next
town
over
from
a
power
plant
and
the
state
had
numerous
signs
posted
for
an
evacuation
route
and
a
place
to
shelter
here
in
massachusetts
seabrook
in
nh
2
miles
from
the
ma
border
right
now
you
re
already
in
a
fallout
zone
vermont
yankee
is
on
the
connecticut
river
and
a
failure
there
would
irradiate
the
entirety
of
western
ma
s
watershed
no
where
in
state
would
be
out
of
a
fallout
zone
if
you
put
it
out
on
the
ny
border
this
would
be
correct
otherwise
you
re
wrong
i
d
much
prefer
to
live
near
a
nuclear
plant
vs
a
coal
or
oil
power
plant
i
d
far
rather
have
a
sewage
plant
than
a
potential
inescapable
invisible
killer
in
my
backyard
js
i
think
a
good
amount
of
it
too
is
that
fossil
fuels
have
a
much
higher
initial
return
on
investment
i
think
we
ve
all
learned
as
of
late
that
people
don
t
give
a
shit
about
the
preservation
of
the
earth
s
resources
especially
if
they
re
rich
even
someone
like
47
with
kids
is
trying
his
best
to
roll
back
regulations
to
protect
the
environment
my
partner
and
i
don
t
even
want
kids
my
brother
doesn
t
want
kids
and
my
partner
is
an
only
child
we
have
zero
incentive
to
help
preserve
the
earth
for
our
own
blood
we
re
just
not
awful
fucking
people
who
only
care
about
ourselves
https

woah
really
what
a
coincidence
teeeeeeeeeeeeeeeechnically
there
is
already
a
nuclear
reactor
there
at
mit
what
are
the
odds
wait
i
completely
coincidently
picked
the
exact
neighborhood
as
to
a
reactor
that
s
been
operating
for
60
years
in
my
example
what
are
the
odds
deleted
not
a
single
person
died
not
a
single
case
of
radiation
induced
death
ah
yes
don
t
worry
the
infallible
smart
people
who
got
us
here
are
working
on
continuing
to
get
us
over
there
somewhere
they
ve
never
led
us
astray
or
let
us
down
before
progress
keeps
progressing
the
military
does
do
it
well
they
aren
t
a
for
profit
utility
company
with
conflicting
interests
you
re
thinking
too
short
term
you
need
to
consider
the
implications
for
millennia
out
from
today
cause
that
s
how
long
these
things
need
to
be
managed
to
not
cause
mass
death
and
generations
of
poisoned
land
you
really
think
industrial
society
is
gonna
be
stable
enough
long
enough
to
manage
these
reactors
if
you
do
you
need
to
learn
more
about
history
and
just
take
a
look
around
at
where
the
world
is
headed
without
issue
that
we
know
of
the
military
isn
t
known
for
its
openness
in
the
ukraine
in
japan
less
than
100
up
front
but
most
radiation
deaths
aren
t
immediate
the
increase
in
the
number
of
cancers
is
measurable
for
tens
of
thousands
of
people
who
lived
in
the
area
and
will
continue
and
there
are
now
two
spots
on
the
globe
that
are
not
safely
inhabitable
for
humans
and
will
not
be
for
as
much
as
20
000
years
into
the
future
how
many
more
of
those
do
you
think
is
a
reasonable
tradeoff
i
m
pro
green
energy
i
m
certain
nuclear
has
a
place
i
don
t
think
that
place
is
necessarily
in
an
earthquake
prone
densely
populated
place
we
can
continue
to
develop
a
mixture
of
green
energy
sources
that
don
t
rely
heavily
on
any
one
technology
and
continue
to
phase
out
environmentally
damaging
ones
while
not
creating
new
forms
of
environmental
damage
or
they
are
weighing
the
fukushima
potential
for
environmental
devastation
against
clean
green
energy
improvements
and
acknowledging
that
nuclear
is
not
the
best
option
in
every
situation
people
who
live
nearby
have
already
made
the
choice
to
ignore
the
potential
risk
i
m
not
surprised
they
aren
t
overly
concerned
about
it
or
doesn
t
want
to
risk
the
consequences
of
a
meltdown
which
is
completely
in
the
realm
of
possibility
anyone
who
argues
that
we
have
to
keep
sustaining
our
energy
consumption
and
lifestyle
and
do
whatever
it
takes
to
produce
the
energy
to
do
that
i
have
to
assume
is
disingenuous
about
their
position
on
climate
change
you
get
out
of
here
with
your
facts
one
of
the
lead
great
white
researchers
for
the
state
of
ma
started
his
career
with
marine
fisheries
researching
lobster
right
off
the
plant
due
to
the
water
being
dumped
all
the
time
it
doesn
t
have
any
affect
even
once
it
s
running
most
estimates
keep
forgetting
decommissioning
costs
which
are
like
half
of
construction
costs
france
is
having
this
issue
pretty
much
all
nuclear
was
state
backed
so
got
no
interest
loans
and
stuff
taxpayer
pays
modern
nuclear
also
requires
way
better
safety
regulations
that
increase
cost
which
are
good
and
e
g
south
korea
added
they
have
to
start
a
fund
in
case
of
nuclear
fall
out
damage
and
it
s
not
enough
funds
there
you
can
check
the
lazard
report
on
levelized
cost
of
energy
older
nuclear
is
competitive
as
paid
off
new
is
not
even
close
to
alternatives
and
we
re
living
at
a
time
where
solar
wind
battery
is
cheaper
than
coal
and
coal
is
like
half
the
cost
of
nuclear
over
its
lifetime
i
ll
tell
you
i
don
t
like
dogmatic
thinking
we
re
all
supposed
to
get
in
line
now
and
push
for
something
as
beyond
debate
while
bitcoin
miners
are
burning
the
house
down
and
amazon
is
squeezing
out
more
profit
with
robotic
warehouses
warehouse
workers
don
t
create
more
carbon
than
robots
but
robots
demand
more
electric
i
m
not
supporting
that
i
don
t
like
belligerents
and
i
think
i
can
tell
the
difference
between
them
and
people
who
are
right
about
things
yes
we
need
to
make
drastic
changes
but
since
we
are
in
so
much
trouble
why
are
we
also
ensuring
the
oligarchs
are
protected
most
changing
least
only
a
bully
will
keep
insisting
nuclear
is
the
safest
energy
on
earth
it
s
not
even
top
10
safest
what
you
expect
conservatives
not
to
lie
real
progressive
this
country
this
world
more
like
no
reported
deaths
but
the
ocean
is
more
radioactive
and
everyone
has
more
cancer
famously
humans
are
no
longer
flawed
uninformed
poorly
trained
corrupted
or
corruptible
short
sighted
arrogant
faulty
prone
to
error
regulation
will
be
put
in
place
for
that
very
reason
i
said
it
as
a
reference
not
as
a
fact
i
m
sorry
i
don
t
have
a
mental
almanac
of
all
nuclear
information
in
my
head
at
a
moments
notice
but
since
i
m
not
a
nuclear
physics
everything
i
know
is
second
hand
anyway
so
good
on
you
sure
but
a
high
profile
incident
is
going
to
impact
people
s
mindset
about
this
sort
of
thing
ditto
for
chernobyl
oh
right
only
smart
people
over
here
dumb
people
over
there
duh
s
but
the
us
is
not
japan
it
was
largely
designed
and
built
by
ge
failsafe
is
the
key
word
in
your
post
famously
we
now
have
newer
models
of
humans
these
days
who
don
t
make
errors
or
do
faulty
procedures
i
misspoke
i
was
thinking
3
mile
island
made
a
mistake
my
bad
good
point
but
i
still
hate
eversource
this
guy
likes
cancer
ig
was
wipp
opened
in

you
re
correct
on
both

surrounding
states
were
suing
about
the

and
obama
owed
harry
reid
rip
a
favor
so
the

got
killed
they
were
actually
working
on
the
next
phase
how
to
warn
people
10
000
100
000
years
in
the
future
to
stay
aware
because
of
the
dangers
the
waste
is
stored
because
its
cheaper
to
store
the
waste
and
mine
process
new
fuel
than
it
is
to
for
lack
of
a
better
term
recycle
the
waste
and
use
it
again
other
countries
actively
recycle
and
reuse
the
waste
and
they
solve
the
waste
storage
problem
once
again
capitalism
and
profits
are
the
cause
of
our
concerns
and
can
go
missing
there
are
some
stored
rods
missing
from
the
closed
ct
yankee
also
too
many
rods
stored
at
one
time
outside
of
specs
if
there
is
a
way
we
can
avoid
more
nuclear
i
wish
we
would
people
get
nervous
around
nuclear
waste
thus
ends
the
sentence
in
reality
it
would
have
needed
to
have
been
rail
transported
cross
country
for
terminal
storage
at
ymp
as
we
know
personally
from
our
experiences
with
the
mbta
despite
weighing
more
than
80
tons
trains
do
come
off
the
tracks
for
more
examples
good
east
palestine
oh
that
had
a
coalition
of
states
and
tribes
banding
together
to
sue
parallel
to
that
former

harry
reid
was
lucky
enough
to
be
both
the
senior
senator
from
nevada
where
the

was
located
and
senate
majority

simultaneously
and
killed
the

the

was
shut
down
for

in

however
that
work
was
completed
it
has
been
operating
for
most
of
2024
and
there
are

ongoing
i
can
guarantee
you
that

in

so
does
umass
lowell
back
in
the
90s
we
went
there
to
have

irradiated
there
used
to
be
a

at
the
watertown
arsenal
also
i
imagine
there
are
quite
a
few
reactors
elsewhere
throughout
the

i
worked
at
a
medical
sterilization
plant
in
central
mass
that
had
a
nuclear
reactor
to
sterilize
certain
medical
equipment
that
came
in

has
been
praised
as
being
one
of
the
most
successful
nuclear

plants
to
ever
been
built
out
of
the
manhattan
project
it
was
the
first
of
its
kind
for
commercial
use
and
function
i
use
to
live
in
north
adams
and
that
whole
area
near
bear
swamp
florida
monroe
has
a
very
strange
feeling
to
it
i
actually
found
a
publicly
distributed
handbook
regarding
what
to
do
in
an
emergency
at
yankee
rowe
issued
by
the
ma
department
of
energy
kind
of
a
cool
piece
of
history
i
believe
it
was
decommissioned
due
to
eol
of
the
concrete
dome
rowe
is
franklin
county
not
berkshire
japan
also
had
a
horrible
meltdown
not
too
long
ago
we
can
claim
it
s
so
safe
but
our
record
has
shown
anything
but
just
because
on
paper
we
can
do
it
the
right
way
doesn
t
mean
it
will
be
i
believe
nuclear
is
the
only
real
option
currently
but
it
s
not
without
major
risks
exxon
valdez
was
mostly
cleaned
up
chernobyl
is
still
abandoned
saying
the
vogtle
plants
3
and
4
in
georgia
were
over
budget
is
putting
it
very
mildly
they
cost
nearly
37
billion
2
6x
the
budget
and
took
15
years
to
build
imagine
how
much
renewables
with
current
technology
could
have
been
built
or
even
research
into
new
technology
with
15
years
and
37
billion
that
is
just
two
reactors
in
the
whole
country
the
reason
that
nuclear
fails
is
because
it
s
insanely
capital
intensive
and
requires
two
decades
to
turn
a
profit
rate
payers
are
forced
to
fund
the
capital
expenses
so
rates
in
georgia
were
significantly
increased
for
over
a
decade
before
the
plants
even
came
online
also
the
doe
has
to
manage
the
security
for
all
nuclear
sites
so
we
have
federal
dollars
being
spent
on
them
in
perpetuity
maybe
we
can
start
to
consider
that
in
30
years
when
fusion
is
actually
a
part
of
the
power
generation
conversation
and
not
just
a
place
for
venture
capitalists
to
plop
their
money
so
that
they
can
feel
like
they
re
saving
the
world
matter
conversion
my
friend
the
fuel
itself
isn
t
burned
off
like
with
fossil
fuels
so
you
can
simply
wait
for
it
to
cool
and
then
use
it
again
if
only
the
most
nuked
place
on
earth
existed
in
the
us
was
inhospitable
and
had
a
large
storage
area
already
built
there
it
d
be
an
amazing
place
to
store
all
that
waste
too
bad
that
s
just
a
dream
there
are
reactors
that
use
the
old
waste
as
fuel
to
https
www
iaea
org
bulletin
when
nuclear
waste
is
an
asset
not
a
burden
waste
is
such
a
stupidly
easy
problem
it
s
absolutely
challenge
to
fix
shipping
nuclear
waste
to
a
secure
location
isn
t
rocket
science
finding
a
secure
location
is
also
a
trivial
problem
we
ship
nuclear
material
all
of
the
time
all
of
the
fuel
for
those
nuclear
reactors
nuclear
ships
and
nuclear
missiles
didn
t
get
to
where
they
are
by
magic
we
literally
shipped
it
to
those
places
and
we
could
literally
just
ship
it
to
a
waste
site
it
s
a
completely
solved
problem
the
problem
with
nuclear
is
purely
political
not
technical
whats
wrong
with
burying
dry
casks
how
is
that
not
a
good
strategy
like
you
said
it
just
sits
there
in
cooling
tanks
they
pose
no
threat
you
are
exposed
to
more
radition
outside
the
cooling
tanks
than
if
you
were
in
the
tanks
with
the
spent
fuel
people
think
theres
this
insurmountable
volume
of
waste
thats
not
true
it
s
90
000
tons
we
burn
815
billion
tons
of
oil
every
year
in
the
us
alone
launch
it
into
space
the
root
cause
of
fukushima
s
failure
was
the
generator
s
location
on
the
mountain
was
too
low
not
where
the
engineers
specified
otherwise
the
plant
would
have
flooded
and
been
back
in
service
within
a
year
the
wave
took
the
generator
out
and
could
not
provide
the
cooling
it
was
designed
to
power
it
s
interesting
when
looking
at
the
usn
nuclear
programme
which
quoting
wikipedia
since
its
inception
in
1948
the
u
s
navy
nuclear
program
has
developed
27
different
plant
designs
installed
them
in
210
nuclear
powered
ships
taken
500
reactor
cores
into
operation
and
accumulated
over
5
400
reactor
years
of
operation
and
128
000
000
miles
safely
steamed
this
is
mainly
because
the
design
principles
around
it
have
safety
as
a
core
tenet
over
output
it
can
be
done
safely
and
our
own
navy
is
a
sign
that
it
has
sure
there
will
be
accidents
as
statistically
that
s
impossible
to
avoid
but
it
is
much
safer
when
properly
designed
than
people
may
think
tl
dr
spicy
rocks
can
be
safe
actually
are
you
really
suggesting
that
design
flaws
and
natural
disasters
won
t
happen
anymore
1
a
design
flaw
combined
with
human
error
and
2
literally
2
acts
of
god
9
0
earthquake
and
tsunami
so
are
we
to
believe
that
humans
have
since
become
infallible
that
acts
of
god
are
no
longer
a
concern
call
me
a
pessimist
but
i
don
t
think
either
of
those
problems
have
been
solved
i
mostly
agree
but
disasters
still
happen
when
multiple
things
go
wrong
we
have
triple
redundancy
in
all
sorts
of
systems
and
things
still
fail
and
putting
a
nuclear
power
plant
in
japan
on
the
coast
expecting
an
earth
quake
and
a
tsunami
where
those
things
tend
to
happen
in
tandem
that
isn
t
a
far
fetched
scenario
i
m
pretty
sure
human
error
is
still
a
thing
and
natural
disasters
are
becoming
much
more
frequent
and
that
wasn
t
two
disasters
anyway
it
was
a
single
event
human
error
and
acts
of
god
yes
those
hardly
ever
happen
god
s
still
got
a
bone
to
pick
with
us
mortals
though
no
happy
cake
day
thanks
for
the
info
if
you
need
phds
to
run
the
place
to
avoid
a
disaster
they
aren
t
really
safe
then
are
they
there
are
technologies
which
cannot
melt
down
location
isn
t
important
research
can
be
done
at
your
mits
and
cal
techs
homer
simpson
worked
at
a
power
plant
was
that
a
joke
by
the
show
utilities
then
see
price
tag
and
ask
if
this
redundancy
or
that
one
is
really
necessary
that
s
how
it
started
at
millstone
people
at
combustion
engineering
said
the
public
absolutely
never
knew
how
dangerous
the
moment
had
become
at
millstone
where
there
were
two
reactors
one
by
ce
the
other
by
ge
we
barely
averted
a
meltdown
there
that
is
what
the
nuclear
plant
industry
said
to
us
back
in
the
1960
s
impossible
to
build
in
enough
failsafes
impossible
it
s
simply
that
the
risk
and
its
consequences
are
far
too
great
to
suffer
no
my
impression
is
commenter
would
prefer
advocates
for
nuclear
make
their
case
without
lying
some
of
us
were
there
some
of
us
listened
to
nuclear
engineers
and
top
execs
from
ge
and
combustion
engineering
when
they
were
frank
and
politicians
who
had
to
deal
with
the
whistleblowers
from
companies
like
cl
p
nka
eversource
which
owned
millstone
in
ct
utilities
will
cut
corners
false
equivalency
again
you
re
pitting
one
argument
against
the
other
and
not
letting
nuclear
stand
on
its
own
merit
you
have
to
go
to
debate
school
man
this
is
not
how
you
forward
the
argument
only
better
technology
will
improve
the
situation
if
you
are
comparing
a
two
airplane
crash
that
killed
500
people
with
a
nuclear
meltdown
that
forced
an
exclusion
zone
of
1000
square
miles
and
has
caused
an
estimated
9000
cancer
deaths
then
you
do
not
understand
the
problem
yeah
your
reply
is
completely
asinine
because
an
airplane
disaster
is
not
a
nuclear
disaster
just
the
fact
that
you
make
that
comparison
shows
up
clueless
the
whole
discussion
is
that
s
exactly
the
point
and
you
just
made
it
it
s
not
like
any
other
disaster
just
because
you
think
you
can
build
it
enough
checks
and
balances
to
prevent
theoretical
situation
it
s
when
the
fuck
it
does
happen
it
s
not
tenerife
it
s
exactly
that
kind
of
idiot
false
equivalency
that
is
the
problem
with
proponents
of
nuclear
bullshit
if
the
vermont
yankee
power
plant
had
not
been
shut
down
on
the
connecticut
river
where
i
live
in
new
hampshire
would
be
avoid
if
something
happened
there
an
absolute
void
possibly
also
affecting
boston
depending
on
the
air
just
ridiculous
assumptions
and
there
were
problems
there
as
well
thank
god
that
s
gone
as
well
as
the
one
in
massachusetts
nutcase
technology
come
back
when
there
s
something
better
well
you
just
said
it
with
your
own
words
man
and
this
is
the
end
of
the
conversation
black
swan
i
could
not
have
made
the
argument
better
myself
thank
you
if
only
the
island
was
4
miles
instead
of
3
everything
would
have
been
self
contained
fuck
man
i
d
live
next
to
a
nuclear
plant
any
day
the
wealthy
did
the
same
thing
with
cape
wind
even
with
normal
reactors
it
really
isn
t
a
concern
just
dig
a
deep
hole
in
a
seismically
stable
area
dump
it
in
the
bottom
of
that
hole
it
isn
t
an
ooze
that
leaks
everywhere
it
s
maintained
in
lined
concrete
casks
the
fear
is
really
overblown
and
a
lot
of
the
anti
nuclear
messaging
has
been
funded
by
guess
who
the
fossil
fuel
industry
define
isn
t
as
bad
more
completely
please
that
s
poor
logic
it
s
like
saying
cigarettes
aren
t
a
legitimate
concern
because
heroin
is
worse
both
can
be
legitimate
concerns
i
can
t
have
a
bigger
family
my
car
is
too
small
was
it
near
pilgrim
because
if
pilgrim
had
a
problem
the
only
way
for
people
to
get
off
cape
cod
was
to
swim
whenever
i
go
by
the
one
in
nh
i
definitely
notice
the
signs
imo
i
think
ma
would
greatly
benefit
from
nuclear
but
having
fukushima
in
recent
memory
does
not
help
sway
others
they
should
have
never
shut
down
vermont
yankee
lmfao
ahh
missed
the
sarcasm
my
bad
it
s
pretty
easy
to
prove
what
caused
radiation
exposure
given
each
type
of
radiation
has
a
signature
like
someone
dying
from
chernobyl
will
be
different
from
someone
dying
from
hiroshima
you
re
incredibly
negative
about
all
of
this
not
necessarily
wrong
mind
you
but
negative
i
ll
be
honest
i
can
t
worry
about
implications
for
millenia
out
from
today
if
we
don
t
figure
out
how
to
manage
our
carbon
output
and
find
the
political
will
to
do
so
of
course
we
as
a
species
are
genuinely
not
going
to
make
it
for
centuries
let
alone
millenia
i
appreciate
your
concern
no
that
phrase
totally
sounds
like
b
s
i
genuinely
appreciate
that
you
re
a
cautious
voice
on
this
if
we
ever
go
forward
with
nuclear
power
which
many
of
us
think
is
important
we
will
obviously
have
to
be
very
careful
with
it
i
just
think
the
concerns
should
be
more
related
to
the
sorts
of
things
that
went
wrong
at
chernobyl
and
fukushima
and
the
sorts
of
negative
impacts
of
e
g
waste
water
in
ongoing
operations
rather
than
worrying
about
what
the
breakdown
of
civilization
would
mean
you
only
answered
half
of
the
question
though
how
does
nuclear
safety
compare
to
the
alternatives
there
s
risk
involved
with
any
power
source
the
chance
of
failure
in
nuclear
especially
in
modern
installations
is
extremely
minimal
the
upsides
are
immense
the
footprint
is
small
compared
to
green
energy
of
comparable
output
the
fuel
is
abundant
often
reusable
and
with
zero
carbon
emission
it
s
a
slam
dunk
in
terms
of
meeting
future
energy
demands
skomal
i
really
don
t
understand
it
any
vehemently
anti
nuclear
power
person
i
ve
met
has
always
been
someone
who
s
a
progressive
or
leftist
someone
who
claims
to
champion
rational
thought
and
to
have
trust
in
professionals
and
institutions
but
when
it
comes
to
nuke
power
and
radiation
exposure
they
suddenly
don
t
sound
too
dissimilar
to
a
religious
nut
anti
vaxxer
or
covid
denier
they
believe
it
s
dangerous
and
you
can
t
tell
them
otherwise
no
matter
how
much
evidence
you
provide
their
mind
is
already
made
up
often
when
asked
fine
what
information
or
evidence
would
it
take
to
change
their
mind
they
don
t
have
an
answer
i
d
respond
to
them
with
more
respect
if
they
weren
t
so
hypocritical
and
didn
t
respond
to
me
with
such
vitriol
you
re
ignoring
the
point
nuclear
has
caused
fewer
deaths
and
fewer
negative
health
outcomes
than
the
alternatives
your
points
about
oligarchs
are
fine
but
not
at
all
the
point
of
discussion
this
is
a
very
hard
comment
to
parse
just
to
make
sure
i
understand
you
you
are
against
pursuing
clean
cheap
near
limitless
energy
because
someone
might
make
money
off
of
it
true
lol
what
a
load
of
bullshit
solar
panels
being
poorly
wired
could
burn
down
a
house
and
kill
a
family
of
4
a
fucking
massive
tsunami
hits
a
nuclear
power
plant
and
causes
0
reactor
attributed
deaths
and
the
who
says
there
is
no
noticeable
rise
in
cancer
and
here
you
are
bitching
about
it
in
a
reddit
comment
exactly
oh
and
you
think
that
that
s
gonna
stick
republicans
the
party
of
deregulation
and
what
kind
of
regulations
are
gonna
be
put
in
place
just
some
like
band
aid
on
top
of
it
pffttt
corporations
and
our
government
have
not
proven
themselves
to
the
american
people
that
they
can
be
trusted
to
do
the
right
thing
for
the
people
until
some
crazy
president
or
stacked
legislative
or
judicial
branch
gets
in
there
and
removes
the
regulation
oh
wait
i
mean
the
very
fact
that
you
re
using
cartoons
a
cynical
surrealist
cartoon
at
that
to
use
as
an
argument
over
nuclear
safety
is
just
gold
yeah
except
don
t
build
a
power
plant
on
a
fault
line
in
one
of
the
most
tsunami
prone
regions
of
the
world
this
is
not
what
s
holding
it
back
as
someone
else
said
public
perception
and
notorious
cost
overruns
are
the
main
problems
you
want
to
nuke
new
york
can
t
fault
you
for
that
haha
yes
but
only
accepts
dod
and
doe
waste
to
the
best
of
my
knowledge
the
cool
part
is
even
in
these
supposedly
millennia
long
lasting
storage
facilites
that
do
exist
they
re
finding
the
casks
breaking
open
because
they
fucked
up
the
packing
of
the
waste
that
s
hands
down
the
1
problem
with
the
safety
of
nuclear
power
the
human
element
we
haven
t
managed
to
un
engineer
human
error
greed
and
laziness
from
the
system
it
s
all
perfectly
safe
as
long
as
1
no
one
fucks
up
2
no
one
cuts
corners
3
no
one
ever
falls
asleep
on
the
job
100
000
years
in
the
future
why
some
people
of
sound
mind
are
reticent
about
fission
nuclear
power
generation
been
in
containment
many
times
place
is
like
walking
into
a
time
machine
from
the
60s
yeah
now
they
just
have
irradiator
rooms
so
you
don
t
have
to
bring
the
mice
there
the
area
is
or
was
a
fairly
big
superfund
site
there
s
was
lots
of
stuff
around
there
are
you
positive
it
was
a
reactor
and
not
a
particle
accelerator
or
a
gamma
ray
source
like
cobalt
60
afaik
it
would
be
very
unusual
to
use
a
reactor
as
a
radiation
source
for
sterilization
good
call
i
didn
t
realize
rowe
and
charlemont
were
in
franklin
county
with
berkshire
east
skiing
being
there
the
berkshires
is
a
region
of
massachusetts
that
encompasses
all
the
hills
west
of
the
connecticut
river
valley
including
more
that
berkshire
county
thanks
for
playing
though
yeah
how
many
died
in
japan
due
to
the
meltdown
not
the
earthquake
or
tsunami
thank
you
for
all
those
details
i
vaguely
remembered
it
was
bad
but
too
lazy
to
look
it
up
where
is
the
energy
coming
from
if
the
mass
is
retained
and
how
long
can
we
keep
playing
that
game
swapping
between
uranium
and
thorium
most
nuclear
waste
is
not
nuclear
fuel
in
theory
nothing
it
s
not
a
new
idea
but
right
now
there
isn
t
any
solution
in
place
it
s
also
not
a
problem
that
people
haven
t
been
trying
to
solve
the
issue
is
implementation
it
s
an
easier
said
than
done
situation
so
instead
with
have
waste
just
chilling
on
site
you
beat
me
to
it
send
it
far
away
on
one
of
elons
fancy
rockets
still
a
bit
insane
that
the
meltdown
failsafe
relied
on
a
generator
no
it
s
at
least
moderately
insane
in
that
location
where
the
earthquakes
are
a
fact
of
life
yes
one
great
thing
about
rocks
is
that
it
s
hard
to
breathe
them
in
if
you
don
t
grind
them
up
ai
will
save
us
just
like
many
advanced
systems
in
the
usa
world
phds
can
design
and
build
write
standard
operating
procedures
to
properly
run
it
train
qualified
technical
people
to
run
it
and
write
quality
system
procedures
that
incorporate
system
checks
and
electronic
monitoring
and
all
that
is
double
checked
by
periodic
audits
from
outside
qualified
firms
nurses
administer
medical
care
without
knowing
the
phd
level
research
that
developed
it
just
because
highly
educated
people
are
needed
to
run
it
doesn
t
mean
they
re
needed
to
avoid
disaster
a
system
be
designed
to
fail
safe
but
still
need
a
lot
of
skilled
labor
in
order
to
be
run
properly
efficiently
that
is
part
of
the
point
though
our
energy
has
to
come
from
somewhere
at
current
battery
tech
renewables
can
t
provide
the
full
load
or
the
necessary
baseline
generation
so
we
have
to
choose
between
nuclear
and
fossil
fuels
to
cover
that
gap
it
s
about
determining
which
trade
offs
are
preferable
and
if
we
want
to
avoid
catastrophic
climate
change
nuclear
may
be
the
better
option
it
s
not
a
false
equivalence
fossil
fuels
are
orders
of
magnitude
more
harmful
to
both
humans
and
the
environment
as
nuclear
and
yet
no
one
seems
to
bat
an
eye
we
re
better
off
with
the
downsides
of
nuclear
than
the
downsides
of
fossil
fuels
that
s
the
point
that
was
a
tough
read
nutcase
technology
come
back
when
there
s
something
better
i
don
t
think
the
technology
is
the
nutcase
here
and
you
know
corporations
will
just
take
and
cut
corners
it
s
not
overblown
and
i
don
t
care
who
s
making
the
anti
nuclear
messaging
there
is
a
ballot
concerns
about
this
let
s
ask
the
atomic
scientists
instead
of
the
energy
companies
what
they
actually

spent

mismanagement
poses

major

to
the

heres
how
trump
is
on
record
supporting
nuclear
energy
hopefully
he
can
get
some
break
throughs
done
while
he
s
in
office
nuclear
sounds
like
a
solid
alternative
we
just
need
to
figure
out
the
disposal
of
it
more
like
saying
maybe
we
don
t
need
additional
regulations
on

for
their

of

when
automobile
odds
are
1
in
5000
cigarettes
vs
heroin
aren
t
really
incommensurable
harms
given
that
the
number
of
cigarette
users
offsets
the
severity
of
heroin
use
you
d
have
to
do
the
math
on
which
one
takes
more
lives
and
what
the
costs
of
prevention
for
each
are
you
re
right
that
everything
can
contribute
to
the
overall
danger
but
from
the
standpoint
of
efficiently
spending
finite
resources
on
the
issue
there
are
far
bigger
fish
to
fry
any
way
that
you
generate
power
has
costs
both
environmental
and
more
acute
health
danger
even
solar
or
wind
the
dangers
posted
by
nuclear
waste
are
far
overblown
relative
to
those
posed
by
every
other
means
of
generating
power
coal
plants
spew
out
more
radioactive
waste
every
day
than
nuclear
plants
do
in
a
year
yet
that
s
normalized
because
of
this
nuclear
taboo
grounded
in
very
very
exceptional
but
very
captivating
examples
they
only
evacuated
a
10mi

around

for
whatever
reason

funny
anecdote
when
i
used
to
live
in
nh
i
worked
for
a
company
that
did
snow
removal
at
the
seabrooke
power
plant
my
coworker
and
i
had
finished
our
shoveling
area
and
we
were
waiting
for
our
boss
to
come
pick
us
up
to
bring
us
across
the
site
we
were
inside
a
small
waiting
room
with
a
mirror
to
keep
warm
we
were
listening
to
some
mid
2000s
hip
hop
sleep
deprived
and
dancing
like
fools
the
mirror
popped
open
and
it
was
3
dudes
with
ars
telling
us
we
looked
stupid
because
you
compared
it
mostly
to
technologies
that
i
agree
are
inferior
i
m
not
arguing
coal
and
oil
are
preferable
theoretically
the
answer
to
coal
and
oil
is
all
of
us
because
unabated
climate
change
exacerbated
by
coal
and
oil
will
render
this
planet
uninhabitable
eventually
but
that
s
a
straw
man
i
guarantee
you
the
deaths
from
hydroelectric
wind
and
solar
are
far
less
than
nuclear
once
we
factor
in
the
long
term
increased
cancer
deaths
from
those
two
accidents
that
s
what
i
m
arguing
for
as
a
better
choice
than
nuclear
in
many
applications
the
chance
of
failure
is
minimal
eh
heard
the
titanic
is
unsinkable
too
chisholm
often
when
asked
fine
what
information
or
evidence
would
it
take
to
change
their
mind
they
don
t
have
an
answer
it
s
always
chernobyl
worst
operational
history
and
a
government
that
said
it
wasn
t
happening
or
fukushima
nobody
died
they
literally
have
no
clue
what
happened
at
either
accident
no
i
think
we
shouldn
t
be
pushed
into
it
without
sacrifice
or
in
order
to
maintain
gratuitous
energy
hogs
and
it
s
only
clean
as
to
carbon
admittedly
a
priority
far
from
clean
per
se
and
though
supposedly
cheap
to
run
it
s
outrageous
to
get
it
built
please
don
t
pretend
you
don
t
understand
that
trump
is
a
closet
democrat
pro
science
and
will
keep
the
republicans
in
check
he
is
for
regulations
he
is
apparently
not
very
interested
in
this
according
to
interviews
both
he
and
vance
did
on
joe
rogan
well
you
all
are
like
saying
look
at
these
democrat
states
that
don
t
have
it
the
west
coast
is
on
a
huge
fault
line
and
i
don
t
blame
them
for
having
those
types
of
strict
regulations
i
m
sure
nothing
bad
will
happen
if
we
keep
burning
fossil
fuels
for
the
next
100000
years
a
you
really
don
t
think
we
ll
be
able
to
to
figure
out
a
solution
to
nuclear
waste
in
the
next
100
000
years
just
because
we
don
t
have
one
now
doesn
t
mean
we
never
will
100
000
years
is
a
long
time
to
solve
that
problem
b
if
we
don
t
stop
burning
fossil
fuels
and
move
onto
an
alternative
source
of
energy
there
won
t
be
anyone
here
in
100
000
years
anyways
sooooooo
my
dad
grew
up
right
around
the
corner
and
worked
in
defense
for
decades
the
reactor
was
the
least
of
their
worries
hmm
i
was
a
low
level
temp
employee
and
it
was
nearly
a
decade
ago
so
i
don
t
really
recall
but
gamma
ray
does
sound
accurate
i
do
recall
they
had
to
shut
the
plant
down
for
a
week
for
maintenance
and
during
that
time
there
were
armed
guards
to
prevent
attacks
you
re
not
really
wrong
the
berkshires
is
an
ambiguous
term
because
it
could
refer
to
the
mountain
range
or
the
county
a
lot
of
the
berkshire
mountain
range
is
east
of
berkshire
county
including
the
highest
point
which
is
in
monroe
not
that
far
from
yankee
rowe
and
a
big
portion
of
berkshire
county
is
west
of
the
berkshire
mountains
the
mountains
on
the
west
side
of
berkshire
county
including
mount
greylock
are
really
the
taconic
mountains
as
a
resident
of
berkshire
county
i
can
assure
you
that
that
is
very
much
a
minority
opinion
locally
i
get
it
it

fossil

alternative

are

and
you
know
it
and
the
idea
that
fossil
fuel
disasters
can
t
also
render
an
area
uninhabitable
is
absurd
for
example
a
coal
mine
explosion
near
centralia
pa
in
1962
is
still
burning
to
this
day
and
the
area
has
been
condemed
ever
since
yeah
humans
tend
to
do
that
you
know
when
you
can
find
a
way
to
operate
a
nuclear
reactor
without
humans
let
us
know
we
have
figured
it
out
deep
hole
like
i
said
no
that
was
a
silly
comparison
we
all
know
about
centralia
and
the
option
of
unbridled
consumption
wasn
t
even
considered
in
your
response
there
s
just
so
much
waste
in
the
system
just
the
way
we
build
the
way
we
piss
it
out
the
window
what
your
suggesting
is
just
more
power
source
to
throw
more
away
jesus

i
can
t
even
recycle
my
goddamn
plastic
bag
with
a
bullshit
clamshell
packing
that
comes
from
every
big
box
store
start
working
on
that
problem
and
are
unbridled
pissing
down
the
drain
of
energy
and
resources
and
then
come
back
to
the
table
and
somebody
might
listen
you
re
just
making
the
argument
more
more
more
more
more
cuz
the
economy
and
the
gnp
and
everything
just
has
to
grow
grow
grow
at
what
expense
who
gives
a
fuck
right
that
s
the
wrong
approach
solar
wind
certainly
limp
along
it
will
not
feel
the
present
glut
of
diet
that
we
desire
something
has
to
change
and
it
s
not
in
the
direction
you
re
talking
about
ha
just
dig
the
hole
deeper
lol
the
reason
plastic
is
so
cheap
is
because
it
s
a
byproduct
of
oil
production
reduce
oil
and
plastic
becomes
less
apealing
you
can
t
just
wave
a
magic
wand
and
make
the
world
start
using
less
plastic
energy
needs
will
still
be
high
even
if
we
cut
out
obvious
waste
like
crypto
and
ai
this
shit
spent
billions
of
years
underground
and
it
was
completely
harmless
once
we
put
it
back
in
the
ground
it
ll
spend
more
billions
of
years
completely
harmless
will
actually
you
could
wave
a
magic
wand
and
make
it
stop
but
there
s
no
willingness
to
do
that
yes
i
m
being
unrealistic
but
nobody
the
fuck
even
bothers
to
change
or
try
to
change
everybody
is
complacent
and
oh
well
just
what
it
is
i
m
always
amazed
especially
younger
people
that
feel
disenfranchised
or
closed
out
of
politics
or
don
t
feel
represented
but
don
t
realize
they
re
wearing
the
magic
slippers
and
could
have
anything
they
want
through
activism
anything
just
take
a
corporation
like
starbucks
and
i
only
just
pick
that
out
of
my
hat
because
everything
is
consolidated
into
just
a
very
large
basket
of
corporation
these
days
but
you
could
pick
that
one
in
all
of
a
sudden
decide
you
wanted
no
throw
away
products
in
boycott
it
it
s
not
an
essential
service
but
boy
would
that
s
in
the
message
is
it
ever
done
just
for
the
hell
of
it
because
you
could
you
could
ignite
a
firestorm
on
tiktok
or
some
other
platform
to
make
this
happen
or
even
talking
about
not
giving
money
to
the
man
the
big
big
resignation
not
going
to
work
and
give
money
to
the
corporation
what
does
everybody
do
run
out
and
do
give
money
to
the
corporation
activism
with
your
dollars
purchasing
power
is
the
surefire
way
to
change
everything
and
on
short
order
but
is
it
done
nahhh
too
lazy
two
complacent
to
unorganized
to
make
a
difference
we
can
even
see
that
in
the
election
cycle
oh
well
i
m
just
preaching
you
re
right
it
s
not
going
to
change
on
a
dime
and
it
s
a
shame
because
it
could
with
a
lot
of
pressure
in
a
new
way
of
thinking
just
producing
more
and
throwing
away
more
is
not
the
way
out
of
the
mess
i
as
you
probably
figured
out
i
m
an
older
guy
and
i
won
t
be
around
forever
but
it
s
saddens
me
that
there
is
no
burning
desire
to
really
change
it
beyond
lip
service
it
s
not
waiting
for
someone
in
washington
or
berlin
or
peking
to
make
it
happen
but
by
making
it
happen
right
on
a
grassroots
level
and
with
the
internet
in
the
capacity
of
all
of
this
instant
screaming
and
connectivity
a
little
fire
could
you
come
in
amazing
blaze
in
no
time
if
people
had
the
collectivity
of
a
mindset
in
a
will
to
do
it
but
the
energy
of
today
is
nah
lets
just
talk
about
it
on
reddit
or
tick
tock
or
wherever
else
in
bitch
and
let
somebody
else
figure
it
out
anyway
rant
over
and
back
to

thanks
for
listening
anyway

this
is
awesome
well
done
i
won
t
lie
it
was
a
huge
inspiration
i
was
thinking
jet
set
radio
and
sunset
overdrive
right
when
i
saw
this
i
moved
all
the
buildings
and
streets
around
but
the
sunset
i
saw
which
inspired
it
was
on
cottage
st
behind
that
church
there
aww
recently
relocated
to
brockton
so
many
nice
people
so
may
crazy
drivers
understand
understand
understand
understand
understand
understand
the
concept
of
love
i
dig
it
before
ma
even
implemented
free
community
college
my
girlfriend
now
wife
went
back
to
school
and
graduated
from
qcc
in
worcester
it
was
basically
free
even
at
that
time
there
were
so
many
state
federal
grants
that
covered
almost
everything
even
her
books
she
took
advantage
of
our
state
s
masstransfer
program
where
you
finish
your
associates
at
a
community
college
and
you
re
guaranteed
a
spot
at
any
participating
state
university
to
get
your
bachelors
no
application
no
fees
she
went
to
framingham
state
and
got
her
degree
in
computer
science
she
made
the
dean
s
list
and
got
offered
a
job
at
a
tech
company
in
marlborough
that
paid
for
her
entire
bachelors
fast
forward
several
years
she
s
a
software
developer
and
we
both
make
well
into
the
six
figures
we
bought
a
home
and
we
live
a
comfortable
life
massachusetts
is
one
of
the
last
remaining
places
in
the
country
where
you
can
still
achieve
this
it
s
because
we
invest
in
each
other
this
is
not
a
perfect
utopia
either
but
there
are
more
paths
to
success
here
than
just
about
anywhere
else
if
you
re
willing
to
put
in
the
work
hey
i
m
a
senior
engineer
who
hires
engineers
i
just
picked
a
state
school
mediocre
gpa
grad
over
an
mit
dean
s
list
the
girl
i
hired
has
spent
a
few
years
learning
blueprints
and
measurement
methods
and
learning
cnc
machines
on
the
floor
with
the
operators
the
mit
grad
spent
2
years
at
a
desk
and
couldn
t
tell
me
what
some
basic
part
marking
callous
even
stood
for
let
alone
what
they
mean
glad
to
see
you
re
taking
life
by
the
horns
don
t
be
discouraged
by
anyone
who
thinks
that
you
can
t
get
there
without
a
fancy
degree
in
some
cases
a
fancy
degree
is
a
hinderance
i
m
damn
near
30
i
m
getting
my
ged
now
and
looking
to
get
into
a
college
program
that
s
accepts
them
it
s
never
too
late
guys
this
state
is
getting
under
expensive
and
the
only
way
to
make
it
with
with
a
trade
or
a
degree
in
another
industry
life
is
crappy
but
living
anywhere
else
would
make
it
a
whole
lot
crappier
im
very
proud
to
be
a
masshole
nice
to
see
some
positive
comments
nice
hustle
dude
keep
it
up
community
college
is
amazing
i
went
to
4
different
colleges
universities
due
to
advancing
my
skills
and
changing
careers
most
of
my
favorite
professors
were
at
the
community
college
where
i
started
to
change
my
career
i
graduated
in
the
top
10
of
my
class
at
university
thanks
in
part
to
community
college
preparing
me
love
our
community
colleges
and
love
that
they
are
more
affordable
than
ever
we
are
constantly
moving
forward
and
getting
better
and
better
i
went
to
4c
s
in
the
80
s
liberal
arts
and
just
the
fact
that
i
attended
college
and
could
put
that
on
my
resume
helped
me
get
jobs
and
promotions
i
settled
in
the
legal
real
estate
fields
and
have
made
decent
money
don
t
let
anyone
tell
you
that
community
college
is
somehow
for
dummies
i
went
there
because
it
was
all
my
parents
could
afford
and
my
h
s
grades
and
sat
scores
sucked
i
learned
how
to
learn
there
more
than
i
did
in
high
school
and
became
independent
free
community
college
is
a
gift
my
family
came
from
a
war
torn
country
with
no
money
when
we
got
here
my
sisters
and
i
were
the
poster
children
of
that
free
school
lunch
kid
we
got
a
lot
of
help
from
different
communities
and
organizations
in
the
area
we
all
went
to
state
school
on
grants
and
loans
we
are
all
doing
very
well
i
doubt
we
could
even
come
close
to
this
in
any
other
states
i
m
in
the
same
boat
and
could
not
have
done
it
if
i
lived
in
any
other
state
graduated
hs
with
flying
colors
really
really
bad
gpa
under
1
joined
the
workforce
for
a
few
years
worked
my
way
up
with
my
company
to
the
point
that
i
needed
a
college
degree
to
keep
moving
forward
was
shocked
to
find
out
about
the
mass
reconnect
program
they
are
paying
for
all
my
classes
and
books
i
m
taking
it
serious
this
time
and
i
m
extremely
thankful
to
live
in
a
state
that
has
these
programs
community
college
grad
here
congrats
moved
here
from
nh
for
work
proud
to
be
a
citizen
of
a
state
that
wants
to
uplift
people
we
can
do
better
bridgewater
state
free
undergraduate
for
ma
residents
making
under
125k
good
job
friend
in
case
you
didn
t
know
the
lift
yourself
up
by
your
bootstraps
line
was
created
by
elites
as
a
derogatory
message
to
the
poor
to
get
themselves
out
of
poverty
it
was
originally
used
to
describe
something
that
was
impossible
to
do
ie
trying
to
lift
yourself
up
by
your
own
shoelaces
well
done
op
your
story
is
one
of
the
reasons
i
love
this
state
i
hope
to
never
leave
traveling
more
both
to
other
states
and
abroad
has
just
solidifed
how
highly
i
regard
ma
i
am
not
proud
to
be
an
american
i
am
proud
to
be
born
and
raised
and
to
live
here
hell
yeah
impressive
story
and
accomplishments
you
should
be
seriously
proud
of
very
very
glad
to
hear
about
parts
of
the
system
working
for
you
yes
plus
human
rights
the
entire
umass
college
system
is
now
tuition
and
fee
free
for
anyone
with
a
household
income
of
less
than
75
000
year
so
keep
up
your
journey
i
like
mass
the
only
problem
i
have
is
the
lack
of
housing
high
costs
for
rentals
and
first
time
buyers
the
community
college
and
mass
transfer
programs
are
brilliant
i
m
so
proud
of
this
state
for
those
congrats
op
teaching
at
a
cc
is
also
good
way
to
give
back
i
started
as
an
adjunct
this
fall
at
bunker
hill
enjoying
it
so
far
we
are
lucky
here
that
people
actually
get
that
education
and
healthcare
for
everyone
is
important
i
keep
fantasizing
that
we
manage
somehow
to
socialize
medicine
in
the
state
so
the
rest
of
the
country
can
see
how
things
should
be
i
m
from
nh
and
northern
essex
was
better
than
anything
nh
had
to
offer
not
to
mention
the
bootstrap
of
mass
health
which
is
critically
important
for
a
lot
of
people
i
know
good
for
you
my
friend
massachusetts
desserves
a
lot
of
kudos
for
free
education
and
healthcare
they
have
proven
it
can
work
and
should
be
a
model
for
the
rest
of
country
this
is
an
investment
that
pays
back
society
hundreds
of
times
over
too
i
wish
our
federal
politicians
would
understand
that
if
you
want
less
problems
in
society
a
well
educated
populous
is
a
perfect
start
congrats
for
your
success
i
taught
for
over
ten
years
in
the
massachusetts
college
system
it
is
great
start
where
you
want
community
college
transfer
to
finish
up
sometimes
in
a
name
private
college
your
education
will
be
good
especially
if
you
work
at
it
if
you
major
in
business
especially
accounting
you
can
get
a
job
anywhere
in
the
country
in
a
week
some
high
schools
are
offering
education
that
will
lead
you
to
a
job
at
graduation
the
trades
medicine
food
services
and
hair
dressing
some
get
you
on
the
job
training
while
you
are
in
high
school
massachusetts
is
a
great
state
to
live
in
because
there
are
lots
of
jobs
available
the
rest
is
up
to
you
good
work
brother
let
s
not
forget
massreconnect
is
because
of
the
millionaires
tax
ballot
initiative
which
barely
passed
this
is
what
any
intelligent
society
would
do
tax
the
wealthiest
citizens
at
a
higher
rate
for
the
betterment
of
the
community
i
love
massachusetts
way
to
go
there
are
no
good
arguments
against
making
community
college
free
for
those
with
low
income
who
maintain
good
standing
in
their
classes
the
return
on
investment
just
has
to
be
positive
thanks
for
sharing
an
uplifting
story
i
ve
started
thinking
of
america
as
the
eu
and
massachusetts
as
my
country
most
of
the
basic
rights
the
country
is
fighting
for
have
been
long
since
fixed
here
community
college
health
care
abortion
gay
rights
decriminalized
weed
minimum
wage
im
proud
to
be
a
masshole
an
american
not
so
much
great
to
see
appreciation
for
massachusetts
values
of
self
reliance
and
hard
work
in
this
post
but
we
don
t
need
educated
elites
we
need
uneducated
poor
people
who
believe
donald
trump
and
the
millionaire
class
are
going
to
magically
make
their
lives
better
by
bringing
down
the
price
of
eggs
and
believe
that
trickle
down
economics
is
actually
a
thing
and
that
they
are
eventually
going
to
be
rich
if
they
work
hard
enough
doing
their
three
minimum
wage
jobs
which
they
have
to
do
to
pay
for
basic
necessities
cool
now
try
to
buy
a
house
this
state
is
fucked
fwiw
mass
severely
underpays
the
people
working
at
community
colleges
like
on
the
order
of
50
compared
to
comm
college
workers
in
ny
and
70
compared
to
ca
where
the
cost
of
living
is
the
same
as
ma
the
system
is
broken
for
the
educators
legislature
needs
to
fix
this
if
the
system
is
going
to
continue
the
automile
norwood
i
didn
t
need
that
memory
this
morning
congrats
on
your
success
ma
helped
but
you
did
the
work
and
made
it
happen
so
hats
off
to
you
cosigned
as
an
evil
out
of
touch
coastal
elite
fully
aware
we
are
very
fortunate
i
wouldnt
want
it
any
other
way
massachusetts
community
colleges
are
awesome
underfunded
like
anything
else
but
better
than
most
other
states
have
masstransfer
is
great
combined
with
a
grant
for
teaching
i
paid
like
15k
total
for
my
undergrad
and
graduated
with
no
loans
qcc
and
other
community
colleges
have
this
perception
of
not
being
rigorous
or
of
quality
but
i
had
a
good
experience
and
learned
a
lot
especially
in
my
stem
classes
i
went
to
north
essex
community
college
i
now
have
2
master
s
degrees
but
i
have
no
associate
s
because
necc
requires
more
electives
for
an
associate
s
degree
than
i
ve
earned
pursuing
two
master
s
i
even
went
back
and
offered
to
pay
the
graduation
fee
they
still
want
to
push
for
more
electives
my
mother
did
the
same
with
qcc
when
my
dad
bailed
she
graduated
from
there
and
got
a
job
as
vocational
disability
examiner
with
great
benefits
and
pay
this
state
is
pricey
but
if
you
do
the
work
it
will
work
for
you
always
happy
to
help
now
remember
this
and
don
t
become
a
selfish
dick
when
you
have
money
taxes
pay
for
things
and
if
we
all
care
enough
to
put
in
the
effort
we
can
make
our
taxes
pay
for
things
like
this
berkshire
community
college
grad
went
onto
umass
and
graduated
2021
i
feel
blessed
to
live
in
this
little
blue
state
10000
to
community
college
im
a
successful
tech
manager
who
went
bcc
umd
naturally
i
can
t
relate
to
any
of
my
coworkers
and
their
experiences
at
private
institutions
but
man
am
i
m
proud
to
be
here
none
of
my
family
is
educated
otherwise
when
i
was
between
my
masters
and
phd
i
was
out
of
work
for
4
months
i
got
really
solid
health
insurance
from
ma
for
free
this
place
is
legit
the
best
i
paid
for
community
college
and
then
eventually
a
degree
at
neu
paid
my
dues
and
now
i
work
in
cybersecurity
and
make
six
figures
i
m
in
my
40s
not
going
to
the
funeral
this
gives
me
a
touch
of
hope
i
got
my
masters
from
bu
while
working
full
time
here
i
m
really
grateful
for
that
ability
i
hoped
so
much
i
could
stay
here
despite
6
years
of
professional
experience
and
a
masters
degree
everywhere
i
ve
been
applying
to
in
my
industry
in
this
state
i
have
a
survival
job
right
now
tells
me
i
need
more
experience
i
m
getting
job
offers
from
other
states
that
i
might
have
to
take
which
really
sucks
i
ve
lived
in
14
states
and
massachusetts
is
by
far
my
favorite
i
don
t
want
to
leave
but
i
don
t
want
my
career
to
plateau
i
benefitted
from
mass
health
romney
care
when
i
really
needed
it
not
to
mention
some
of
the
best
beaches
and
world
class
healthcare
just
turned
30
in
october
graduated
with
my
bachelors
in
hospitality
management
in
august
i
started
my
dream
job
at
a
non
profit
day
after
i
turned
30
i
will
keep
saying
that
this
thirties
are
for
thriving
recent
politics
have
my
wife
and
i
planning
out
emergency
scenarios
in
case
we
have
to
flee
the
country
we
know
it
s
highly
unlikely
but
it
makes
us
feel
better
to
have
plans
anyway
stories
like
this
make
it
harder
to
think
about
leaving
mass
we
ve
only
been
here
a
few
years
but
it
s
already
grown
on
us
so
much
mostly
do
love
living
in
this
state
for
the
last
50
years
i
think
i
hate
the
north
shore
cape
ann
traffic
with
a
passion
sounds
like
you
put
in
a
lot
of
the
work
to
pull
yourself
up
and
i
agree
it
s
great
this
state
provides
bootstraps
but
kudos
to
you
for
the
long
hours
put
in
to
pull
yourself
up
all
that
with
majority
republican
governors
over
the
last
100
years
fucking
love
community
college
that
shit
is
a
gateway
to
a
better
life
even
when
times
are
hard
it
s
a
great
state
i
just
got
caught
up
in
the
tech
layoffs
from
a
big
corporation
getting
public
healthcare
through
masshealth
was
legitimately
easier
than
signing
up
previously
for
private
healthcare
through
my
job
yet
another
massachusetts
w
it
sure
beats
ohio
this
is
not
where
i
parked
my
car
wish
i
had
done
this
went
straight
to
fisher
misunderstood
what
fafsa
was
dropped
out
because
my
dad
died
and
was
charged
an
additional
semester
even
though
i
unenrolled
i
m
still
in
debt
and
this
was
2013
i
moved
from
ct
to
ma
then
nh
and
back
to
ma
and
this
state
allowed
me
the
opportunity
to
buy
a
car
and
get
a
job
in
state
that
pays
six
figures
before
that
i
was
struggling
in
ct
to
find
any
job
in
pharma
or
biotech
people
shit
on
massachusetts
but
there
is
so
much
more
opportunity
and
affordable
properties
compared
to
connecticut
i
m
grateful
to
this
state
for
giving
me
the
life
i
deserved
what
did
ma
do
exactly
sounds
like
you
worked
full
time
no
cash
under
the
table
and
probably
got
very
little
help
sounds
like
you
paid
for
your
own
apt
since
single
your
income
probably
cut
you
off
from
a
lot
of
the
easier
to
get
help
paid
for
your
own
car
insurance
studied
while
working
full
time
etc
cheaper
insurance
free
school
all
i
am
saying
is
what
you
described
sounds
like
exactly
what
every
hard
working
person
does
to
get
ahead
and
very
little
help
is
required
for
such
a
go
getter
in
the
usa
who
is
healthy
here
come
the
down
votes
fuck
yeah
man
good
for
you
pulled
the
shit
outta
those
bootstraps
love
this
for
you
beware
the
demographic
cliff
the
state
is
seeing
enrollment
for
state
schools
and
colleges
dropping
due
to
drops
in
birth
rates
in
the
last
2
decades
i
know
funding
has
increased
but
we
might
see
a
consolidation
in
schools
and
programs
if
you
are
considering
enrolling
do
it
now
later
it
might
be
too
late
thats
great
not
to
be
that
guy
but
were
you
using
the
term
bootstraps
a
little
tongue
in
cheek
i
often
to
the
point
of
annoyance
like
to
bring
up
the
fact
that
phrase
was
originally
used
to
dismiss
the
idea
that
anyone
does
anything
wholly
by
themselves
because
its
impossible
to
pull
yourself
by
your
bootstraps
this
is
so
great
to
hear
too
often
especially
within
these
discussions
all
we
hear
is
how
nobody
can
make
it
anymore
all
the
while
blaming
everyone
else
you
are
proof
that
it
can
be
done
all
it
takes
is
putting
in
the
effort
good
for
you
so
what
job
did
you
end
up
getting
it
s
incredibly
refreshing
to
read
a
positive
post
like
this
good
for
you
and
keep
on
grew
up
in
ny
moved
to
ma
for
college
and
basically
never
left
i
love
it
here
we
re
the
best
and
now
it
s
free
mass
health
and
the
dua
while
unemployed
are
you
algerian
horatio
bunker
hill
to
faber
massbay
start
here
go
anywhere
i
love
it
here
i
moved
here
from
idaho
and
our
quality
of
life
both
as
queer
people
and
very
uh
moneyless
people
has
been
drastically
better
it
certainly
isn
t
easy
but
it
s
so
much
better
than
where
we
were
everyone
in
my
house
makes
around
20k
year
and
it
s
rough
out
there
but
absolutely
nothing
beats
masshealth
and
the
local
community
colleges
nothing
i
never
want
to
leave
this
place
and
i
m
very
dedicated
to
keeping
it
how
it
is
improving
it
especially
in
the
next
few
years
we
wouldn
t
have
survived
without
moving
here
and
i
m
infinitely
grateful
for
whatever
cosmic
entity
and
a
local
trans
relocation
group
was
able
to
keep
us
safe
on
the
3000
mile
drive
here
for
once
i
actually
have
hope
and
faith
in
community
can
felons
apply
for
this
program
don
t
forget
ma
gave
you
hand
up
but
your
hard
work
made
your
dreams
real
i
don
t
mind
paying
my
taxes
here
because
it
goes
to
the
ideas
i
value
education
and
helping
my
community
be
the
best
they
can
congrats
you
did
all
the
hard
work
lol
massachusetts
does
not
try
to
help
you
what
they
are
doing
is
getting
you
ready
to
be
one
of
its
tax
players
taxachussetts
is
not
for
working
man
it
used
to
be
but
those
years
are
long
gone
if
you
make
over
a
certain
threshold
you
get
taxed
to
hell
houses
rent
is
out
of
this
world
expensive
gas
is
outrageous
pot
holes
everywhere
traffic
is
unbearable
no
parking
but
yet
they
have
millions
billions
to
give
to
illegals
in

massachusetts
sucks
been
here
for
70
years
its
way
worse
the
past
4
years
the
state
is
in
trouble
with
the
government
dems
are
damaging
the
state
beyond
repair
now
what
this
country
was
designed
for
somebody
to
have
the
freedom
to
pursue
happiness
it
s
not
friggin
guaranteed
i
don
t
know
what
you
are
alluding
to
from
the
bootstraps
in
your
heading
if
you
wanna
make
decent
money
or
a
lot
of
money
you
friggin
take
it
become
an
electrician
you
can
make
200
grand
a
year
within
five
years
how
s
that
for
bootstraps
i
wish
that
masstransfer
got
more
attention
it
seems
like
a
fantastic
program
you
said
free
community
college
in
massachusetts
that
s
an
amazing
story
congrats
to
you
and
your
wife
and
if
you
choose
to
have
kids
you
both
can
actually
stay
home
and
enjoy
parental
leave
regardless
of
your
employers
policies
stuff
like
this
makes
me
proud
to
be
from
and
living
in
ma
qcc
is
excellent
i
highly
recommend
it
i
m
currently
at
bsu
and
starting
next
fall
they
are
doing
something
similar
to
the
community
college
thing
i
don
t
know
all
the
details
except
that
if
you
make
under
like
125
000
you
get
free
tuition
and
mandatory
fees
this
college
is
already
decently
affordable
cheaper
than
others
i
looked
into
great
programs
and
most
of
the
staff
have
been
wonderful
just
thought
i
d
share
some
info
for
anyone
looking
around
for
a
college
i
also
used
masstransfer
which
made
the
transition
from
community
college
to
state
university
so
simple
shoutout
for
qcc
i
did
a
degree
there
to
help
me
change
fields
after
earning
a
bachelor
s
at
a
private
four
year
school
and
felt
like
qcc
gave
me
way
better
value
for
my
money
i
went
to
umass
boston
and
so
many
kids
came
from
the
transfer
program
it
is
a
fantastic
program
and
graduates
from
it
are
some
of
the
hardest
working
coolest
people
i
know
yay
go
massachusetts
congratulations
excellent
work
hey
what
s
the
company
she
was
hired
at
my
boyfriend
is
a
new
graduate
with
two
degrees
computer
science
and
math
and
the
job
market
sucks
california
has
a
similar
program
where
you
can
get
an
associates
and
get
guaranteed
transfer
to
any
participating
colleges
i
m
proud
of
your
wife
a
quick
google
search
says
35
states
have
free
tuition
at
community
college
good
job
and
congrats
to
your
girlfriend
but
just
to
be
clear
many
states
have
guaranteed
transfers
from
community
colleges
to
state
uni
a
ton
of
my
high
school
class
took
that
route
to
get
to
our
state
flagship
this
was
a
red
state
with
no
offense
a
better
public
university
system
than
ma
go
rams
that
s
good
to
hear
as
a
machinist
we
always
prefer
engineers
who
have
common
sense
and
hands
on
experience
on
the
floor

working

something
for
sure
to
be
proud

f
yeah
all
state
schools
including
umass
pretty
sure
mit
is
too
but
ya
know
sadly
harris
walz
and
a
democrat
congress
would
ve
helped
with
those
went
to
necco
to
learn
how
to
study
after
goofing
of
in
high
school
and
flunking
out
as
freshman
at
ulowell
after
necco
transferred
to
umass
amherst
for
bachelor
s
then
northeastern
law
big
fan
of
necc
very
true
so
many
hardworking
people
who
work
full
time
still
need
masshealth
and
food
stamps
etc
i
hate
when
people
talk
as
if
people
who
use
these
benefits
are
lazy
yup
that
s
why
most
people
get
their
education
and
leave
unless
you
have
family
wealth
it
s
a
never
ending
battle
to
hang
on
the
landlords
alone
will
rob
you
of
everything
you
work
for
what
s
wrong
with
it
did
you
inquire
about
a
reverse
transfer
option
i
work
at
a
community
college
and
we
do
this
all
the
time
would
mass
transfer
credit
for
prior
learning
work
they
ve
got
a
program
where
you
can
get
credits
for
past
work
hobbies
like
if
you
taught
yourself
how
to
paint
and
have
a
portfolio
that
can
be
submitted
to
them
and
if
you
re
approved
you
can
get
credits
equal
to
in
that
case
a
painting
class
the
downvotes
would
be
because
you
can
t
read
shhhh
people
in
this
sub
think
we
re
the
only
state
that
has
colleges
in
it
and
that
ops
story
isn
t
possible
anywhere
else
in
the
us
you
do
have
a
point
i
upvoted
because
you
re
right
lolz
didn
t
know
6
was
taxed
to
hell
so
funny
how
people
move
to
nh
because
no
taxes
and
then
find
out
their
property
taxes
are
twice
as
much
massachusetts
is
about
in
middle
of
50
states
in
terms
of
tax
burden
but
it
has
best
health
insurance
and
pretty
good
schools
and
public
services
bet
it
was
fun
living
in
red
state
with
no
unemployment
during
covid
why
so
angry
he
didn
t
say
you
shouldn
t
take
up
a
trade
instead
of
college
by
the
way
mass
has
trade
schools
too
my
brother
is
an
electrician
i
used
it
i
got
my
associates
degree
from
northern
essex
community
college
and
then
transferred
later

boston
i
used

thank
you
we
have
a
2
y
o
daughter
with
a
baby
boy
on
the
way
speaking
of
this
wonderful
state
our
first
pregnancy
was
ectopic
my
wife
had
to
have
an
abortion
at
week
8
to
save
her
life
she
experienced
bleeding
and
severe
abdominal
pain
so
we
rushed
to
the
beth
israel
er
in
brookline
and
they
said
she
was
close
to
rupturing
her
fallopian
tube
it
kills
women
but
thanks
to
massachusetts
getting
a
life
saving
abortion
was
not
an
issue
politically
speaking
nobody
batted
an
eye
we
received
incredible
urgent
treatment
from
beth
israel
the
doctors
nurses
were
wonderful
we
successfully
delivered
a
baby
girl
our
2nd
time
around
and
got
to
use
all
that
pfml
to
bond
with
our
rainbow
baby
i
m
so
proud
to
live
here
and
say
i
was
born
raised
here
i
m
proud
to
raise
my
family
here
again
we
re
not
perfect
here
but
we
are
undoubtedly
leaps
bounds
better
than
most
states
i
have
taken
classes
at
stcc
gcc
and
hcc
all
of
them
are
great
schools
i
loved
bsu
got
my
bachelor
s
degree
in
biology
back
in
2011
for
17
000
for
all
4
years
i
had
to
commute
but
it
was
worth
not
being
in
crushing
debt
for
years
unfortunately
no
hiring
is
such
shenanigans
that
the
4
candidates
i
got
to
were
already
filtered
by
hr
and
8
levels
of
ai
bullshit
temp
agencies
are
great
especially
comp
sci
he
ll
be
able
to
do
contracts
and
get
exposed
to
different
languages
and
applications
to
build
his
portfolio
i
temped
for
2
years
and
got
6
different
contracts
learned
6
different
qms
setups
erp
systems
floor
layouts
management
styles
etc
etc
i
d
rather
a
state
school
4
years
hopping
around
looking
for
a
stable
setup
than
an
mit
grad
who
spent
5
years
and
has
no
other
viewpoints
which
is
exactly
what
i
was
faced
with
in
hiring
really
depends
on
a
bunch
of
factors
could
be
resume
could
be
where
he
s
applying
to
etc
generally
if
he
s
not
getting
interviews
oas
he
should
look
to
improve
his
resume
he
should
check
out
r
engineeringresumes
for
guidance
feedback
it
s
also
just
a
tough
market
overall
i
hired
an
engineer
finished
my
undergrad
at
35
the
17
year
plan
is
not
for
everyone
and
i
don
t
recommend
it
got
a
masters
at
38
the
older
i
got
the
easier
the
class
work
was
just
a
needed
a
change
in
mindset
good
luck
i
believe
the
state
universities
have
not
all
announced
programs
yet
it
may
only
be
bsu
well
the
point
is
it
s
supposed
to
be
a
two
year
degree
but
you
ll
take
more
unnecessary
courses
in
that
two
years
than
if
you
had
just
pursued
a
four
year
degree
outright
it
s
great
to
knock
some
courses
out
but
if
you
re
going
onto
a
bachelor
s
degree
you
should
know
it
s
kind
of
a
waste
to
pursue
an
associates
at
least
at
necc
it
s
better
to
just
do
the
focused
requirements
and
just
enough
electives
to
transfer
dude
should
try
going
to
community
college
for
that
the
community
college
program
allowing
one
to
go
for
free
was
only
started
in
2023
late
2023
i
think
getting
an
associate
degree
in
a
single
year
is
pretty
amazing
if
that
is
the
program
he
is
talking
about
most
people
take
two
years
using
quinsig
comm
college
in
worcester
for
example
is
only
200ish
a
credit
so
a
3
credit
class
would
be
about
600
700
so
a
full
load
per
semester
would
be
about
2400
3000
in
the
past
massassoit
to
bsu
i
used
it
to
go
from
holyoke
community
college
to
umass
and
it
was
a
pain
in
the
ass
i
had
to
go
back
to
hcc
to
finish
my
degree
because
umass
hcc
didn
t
bother
to
tell
me
that
some
credits
didn
t
transfer
until
about
a
month
before
i
was
supposed
to
graduate
i
had
to
finish
my
degree
in
absentia
of
course
you
mileage
may
very
but
the
point
is
that
even
masstransfer
can
get
bogged
down
in
bureaucracy
and
redtape
nonsense
can
i
ask
if
you
know
is
there
a
time
period
to
work
within
between
the
associates
transfer
that
s
awesome
bummer
i
m
literally
15
minutes
from
the
mass
border
i
m
in
ny
no
free
college
here
i
don
t
think
it
s
free
for
everybody
i
think
that
s
been
a
misleading
idea
out
there
it
s
free
for
people
who
meet
certain
financial
aid
requirements
and
bridgewater
state
university
as
well
i
believe
their
family
income
limit
is
125k
i
m
so
sorry
for
your
loss
i
m
glad
you
are
both
healthy
now
at
least
yep
my
fianc
and
i
talked
a
few
times
about
leaving
and
everything
you
listed
in
both
comments
is
why
we
stay
love
mass
excited
to
raise
our
future
family
here
i
was
born
at
beth
israel
almost
50
years
ago
an
emergency
c
section
even
though
my
mom
s
friend
drove
her
up
to
boston
from
the
lower
cape
always
will
have
a
soft
spot
in
my
heart
for
that
hospital
congrats
on
your
growing
family
and
for
also
being
a
certified
masshole
so
you
re
upset
that
the
state
is
getting
better
and
helping
even
more
i
too
like
making
random
assumptions
private
universities
fuck
up
like
this
too
so
it
isn
t
necessarily
the
red
tape
just
people
not
knowing
their
jobs
i
hope
all
ended
well
for
you
the
fuck
ups
are
costly
though
i
was
in
a
dual
masters
program
at
a
private
ma
university
had
my
meeting
to
review
my
credits
and
was
set
to
walk
all
the
boxes
had
been
checked
had
my
cap
and
gown
but
they
called
me
the
following
week
literally
days
before
graduation
to
tell
me
i
didn
t
have
enough
credits
at
least
they
said
i
could
walk
since
family
from
out
of
state
had
already
arrived
but
i
wouldn
t
get
a
diploma
i
got
it
in
the
mail
the
next
semester
after
completing
whatever
requisite
they
told
me
i
met
but
hadn
t
actually
i
won
t
even
get
started
on
the
bs
i
went
through
for
licensing
because
someone
somewhere
did
not
to
the
internship
requirements
for
the
very
particular
license
i
was
in
school
for
whatever
life
ended
up
fine
but
it
sure
af
made
my
20s
more
tumultuous
and
expensive
than
necessary
i
ran
into
the
problem
where
it
didn
t
transfer
anywhere
except
for
westfield
due
to
an
oral
agreement
with
the
hcc
s
professor
umass
amherst
doesn
t
do
it
just
computer
science
i
got
into
umass
lowell
but
they
wanted
me
to
retake
my
entire
major
so
i
stopped
and
just
got
some
certifications
i
think
there
is
something

i
am
not
upset
my
very
first
question
which
the
op
did
not
clearly
state
was
what
did
ma
do
for
him
should
i
just
assume
maybe
he
is
only
23
years
old
and
he
does
not
get
free
college
with
massreconnect
the
newer
version
of
the
program
is
even
newer
then
to
finish
a
degree
in
12
months
that
is
a
lot
of
credits
really
fast
maybe
the
op
only
needed
a
semester
or
two
to
finish
up
previous
schooling
at
comm
college
or
maybe
he
is
just
making
up
shit
go
read
his
previous
posts
wait
what
why
on
earth
don
t
they
make
this
more
known
i
applied
for
assistance
around
2014
and
was
told
i
made
too
much
money
mind
you
i
made
minimum
wage
at
the
time
this
thing
you
posted
i
m
actually
qualified
for
thanks
for
mentioning
this
not
regardless
of
age
you
have
to
be
25
or
older
but
you
have
to
fill
out
a
fasfa
they
did
clearly
state
it
though
in
the
post
you
re
just
upset
that
you
didn
t
have
an
overwhelming
amount
of
evidence
to
answer
all
your
unnecessary
questions
it
may
not
have
been
a
thing
in
2014
the
linked
article
said
it
started
in
2018
in
ny
it
s
fairly
new
in
ma
as
well
it
definitely
wasn
t
available
to
me
when
i
was
getting
out
of
high
school
there
s
a
legit
thing
in
public
policy
decision
making
where
if
we
publicize
a
program
it
ll
encourage
people
to
use
it
thus
making
it
unaffordable
to
maintain
so
we
lets
these
programs
exist
but
don
t
advertise
there
are
now
two
programs
out
there
for
free
commenty
college
in
ma
one
has
been
around
for
awhile
for
those
25
massreconnect
the
new
one
just
started
this
year
mass
educate
and
is
available
to
students
under
25
as
well
that
age
restriction
was
the
previous
iteration
of
the
program
the
below
quote
is
directly
from
the
link
i
provided
above
building
on
the
success
of
massreconnect
which
made
community
college
free
for
students
25
years
and
older
the
healey
driscoll
administration
and
state
legislature
made
public
community
college
free
for
students
of
any
age
and
income
in
massachusetts
it
looks
like
you
do
it
may
be
to
make
sure
you
are
not
in
default
on
any
ed
loans
and
possibly
to
determine
eligibility
for
aid
not
covered
by
the
program
this
program
waives
tuition
and
some
other
stuff
but
there
are
other
costs
that
may
need
to
be
covered
by
other
grants
loans
yes
you
must
fill
out
the
fafsa
and
if
you
are
not
qualified
for
the
pell
grant
to
cover
tuition
fees
and
expenses
the
state
will
cover
it
there
was
something
back
then
a
coworker
told
me
about
it
so
i
applied
and
got
denied
i
wanna
say
it
was
called
fafsa
i
really
can
t
remember
to
be
honest
but
it
was
for
low
income
people
to
afford
college
that
makes
a
lot
of
sense
but
it
s
still
ridiculous
yep
totally
misread
thanks
for
the
clarification
yeah
that
was
different
these
programs
are
way
better
it
s
nice
to
see
some
states
with
actual
progress
even
if
we
missed
the
boat
on
them
actually
respectfully
i
don
t
think
this
is
true
i
work
for
masshealth
and
we
often
encourage
people
to
use
all
programs
available
to
them
because
they
can
the
reason
for
this
is
because
it
shows
public
need
we
can
collect
data
and
come
to
policy
makers
and
say
see
look
people
want
this
program
and
they
are
using
it
this
often
holds
up
even
better
than
public
rhetoric
around
an
issue
obamacare
aka
the
aca
is
the
perfect
example
of
this
people
say
they
don
t
like
it
because
of
ugly
politics
but
the
numbers
don
t
lie
millions
of
people
depend
on
the
programs
made
possible
by
the
aca
i
would
say
you
should
share
this
info
as
much
as
possible
and
definitely
share
with
others
and
policy
makers
how
it
benefited
you
ops
story
is
fantastic
it
s
a
great
showcase
on
how
an
average
person
s
life
was
made
better
by
a
social
program
this
is
what
public
servants
love
to
hear
i
think
sadly
people
hate
on
social
programs
because
of
the
stigma
associated
with
them
but
the
truth
is
we
all
need
our
communities
to
survive
and
we
all
pay
a
ton
in
taxes
that
we
should
directly
benefit
from
random
note
a
great
small
way
to
contribute
to
public
programs
is
to
get
a
library
card
to
your
local
library
even
if
you
don
t
use
it
you
re
adding
to
their
numbers
so
they
can
get
more
funding
for
the
folks
who
use
the
library
and
depend
on
it
okay
i
m
off
my
soapbox
now
what
irritates
me
was
getting
denied
like
i
worked
minimum
wage
25
hrs
a
week
and
i
was
told
i
made
too
much
money
wtf
am
i
supposed
to
do
quit
my
job
then
apply
these
programs
seem
to
cater
to
the
absolute
lowest
class
and
that
s
awesome
for
them
but
what
about
those
of
us
that
work
hard
and
simply
don
t
make
enough
anyways
i
m
just
ranting
but
yes
it
seems
there
s
more
help
today
than
a
decade
ago
and
that
s
great
word
of
mouth
totally
different
but
when
was
the
last
time
you
saw
tv
social
media
mbta
vehicle
billboards
ads
for
wic
the
gas
meters
in
the
building
are
walled
off
so
no
one
has
access
or
is
there
a
door
locked
out
by
the
mgmt
company
i
can
t
believe
it
s
legal
to
totally
block
access
to
meters
because
they
need
to
be
swapped
out
by
law
every
so
many
years
try
calling
n
grid
and
tell
them
you
think
you
smell
gas
in
the
basement
they
will
have
to
send
someone
to
check
it
if
they
can
t
access
the
meters
then
i
think
that
would
be
a
problem
my
readings
are
also
done
remotely
in
that
i
believe
they
just
drive
around
and
scan
for
readings
no
one
physically
comes
to
the
meter
anymore
i
do
occasionally
check
the
numbers
to
make
sure
they
are
accurate
if
you
ve
been
getting
estimates
for
a
year
the
cost
of
gas
usage
has
gone
up
significantly
since
then
my
bills
are
higher
despite
my
usage
being
less
than
the
same
periods
last
year
i
know
this
because
before
i
started
getting
estimates
my
actual
gas
usage
was
12
a
month
i
suspect
that
what
you
know
is
faulty
12
month
doesn
t
even
cover
the
delivery
fees
12
month
is
an
unrealistically
low
gas
bill
this
sounds
more
like
you
were
being
undercharged
for
some
reason
and
now
you
are
getting
your
real
bill
if
your
meter
is
being
read
remotely
then
it
would
be
an
actual
not
an
estimated
read
i
would
confirm
the
readings
with
ng
and
if
they
are
in
fact
estimates
coordinate
an
actual
read
with
the
management
company
for
access
for
ng
and
ng
and
get
a
true
up
for
your
bill
good
luck
seems
like
a
lot
of
extra
nonsense
just
to
get
a
utility
bill
corrected
most
meters
are
read
remotely
it
s
very
rare
that
meters
would
be
physically
visually
read
if
your
meter
is
really
this
old
it
certainly
needs
to
be
replaced
anyway
continue
to
set
aside
the
money
but
stop
paying
the
bill
they
will
need
access
to
shut
it
off
at
that
point
they
will
be
able
to
obtain
a
read
you
re
investing
way
too
much
time
and
energy
into
this
blocking
off
gas
meters
like
that
isn
t
legal
call
your
town
s
fire
department
contact
your
state
representative
s
office
they
re
good
at
making
things
happen
offer
them
dilemmas
don
t
beg
for
compliance
do
x
or
i
will
be
forced
to
do
y
hey
management
you
said
in
mediation
that
i
always
have
access
to
my
meter
please
contact
me
or
open
the
door
for
me
by
friday
or
i
will
be
hiring
a
locksmith
to
open
it
for
me
and
deducting
that
money
from
rent
paid
this
month
hi
national
grid
you
said
in
mediation
you
re
reading
my
meter
remotely
however
you
are
sending
me
estimated
bills
please
resolve
this
issue
or
i
will
be
putting
the
money
in
escrow
as
far
as
the
meters
being
read
remotely
i
think
part
of
the
wall
is
because
they
have
tapped
into
my
gas
the
first
floor
apartment
was
vacated
and
they
had
it
empty
for
months
they
renovated
it
illegally
no
permits
no
dump
for
waste
they
shut
the
water
off
to
the
building
many
times
for
the
same
project
with
no
warning
to
tenants
one
time
i
was
about
to
step
into
the
shower
when
they
shut
it
off
things
are
fine
all
actual
readings
you
can
tell
by
the
colors
in
the
bar
graph
then
november
of
2023
hits
and
everything
from
that
point
is
estimated
geez
those
poor
dogs
what
a
twist
after
reading
the
title
then
the
first
paragraph
i
was
not
expecting
this
to
be
about
national
grid
are
the
dogs
locked
in
crates
all
day
while
you
and
your
husband
work
what
else
is
there
to
do
uh
not
lock
your
dogs
up
for
12
hours
let
s
start
there
i
think
i
see
the
problem
here
this
is
capitalism
keep
everyone
living
in
precarity
make
everyone
spend
their
time
and
dignity
just
trying
to
survive
hours
on
the
phone
with
national
grid
hours
on
the
phone
with
united
health
staying
awake
all
night
worrying
about
how
you
re
going
to
pay
your
bills
landlords
jacking
up
rents
private
equity
buying
up
housing
making
it
unaffordable
making
life
an
endless
struggle
for
the
poor
and
working
class
call
your
state
representatives
yup
you
must
be
exactly
right
except
since
this
wasn
t
pertinent
to
this
situation
i
did
receive
a
bill
from
ng
the
gas
side
for
17
516
42
2
years
ago
when
the
whole
issue
of
changing
the
meter
out
came
up
and
i
let
them
in
to
change
it
and
we
went
over
the
bills
for
the
past
3
years
and
found
the
mistake
on
their
part
mind
you
and
a
new
meter
was
put
in
and
for
the
next
year
things
were
fine
until
last
november
when
everything
became
an
estimate
so
sure
there
was
a
bill
discrepancy
and
sure
i
was
being
incorrectly
charged
however
not
in
how
you
think
and
not
with
a
whole
lot
of
misinformation
on
my
part
thank
you
donna
from
the
department
of
utilities
consumer
division
was
very
helpful
when
i
had
a
dispute
with
national
grid
electric
side
i
know
you
said
you
spoke
to
the
department
of
utilities
but
they
separated
out
a
division
specifically
because
of
issues
with
national
grid
and
eversource
i
assume
you
spoke
with
them
but
mentioning
it
just
in
case
good
luck
this
stuff
is
so
frustrating
also
noting
that
national
grid
was
reading
the
wrong
meter
for
my
house
for
several
years
might
be
worth
confirming
they
have
the
right
meter
associated
to
your
apartment
contact
the
attorney
general
s
office
they
have
programs
to
help
with
these
issues
6177272200
or
https
www
mass
gov
contact
the
attorney
generals
office
call
the
fire
department
and
report
a
gas
leak
lol
they
ll
find
it
can
we
call
animal
control
on
you
or
do
fire
codes
allow
for
gas
meters
to
be
inaccessible
if
you
voted
for
maura
healey
its
called
consequences
she
has
been
at
war
with
natural
gas
for
over
a
decade
it
is
a
lot
however
when
i
move
and
i
am
moving
i
am
not
going
to
be
tied
with
a
bill
that
is
not
of
my
making
if
all
agencies
that
can
do
something
won
t
well
here
we
are
trying
to
find
alternative
ways
to
accomplish
my
goals
no
one
is
required
to
help
or
comment
but
if
you
choose
to
at
least
don
t
be
a
d
ck
also
if
i
do
call
and
report
the
of
gas
besides
that
one
off
i
don
t
think
it
will
fix
my
problem
i
think
next
month
it
will
be
right
back
to
it
unless
someone
thinks
they
will
take
that
opportunity
to
install
remotely
read
ones
i
ve
spoken
to
several
ng
people
one
thing
they
can
all
agree
on
is
that
it
does
seem
strange
that
they
haven
t
received
any
readings
either
hence
the
letters
that
started
coming
about
checking
the
pipes
i
see
them
in
the
mailboxes
all
the
time
and
that
s
where
they
stay
have
been
there
for
3
months
also
the
gas
estimated
is
40
even
with
the
rise
in
price
i
do
my
diligence
and
find
the
lowest
price
per
unit
as
i
do
with
my
electric
1
this
would
still
be
too
much
2
estimated
for
a
year
is
absurd
my
vote
is
if
they
can
t
prove
it
s
you
cut
a
hole
in
the
wall
and
build
your
own
hallway
to
the
gas
meters
that
way
they
cant
claim
someone
did
it
for
storage
and
also
can
t
prove
it
was
you
who
did
it
otherwise
say
you
smell
gas
and
have
someone
be
forced
to
come
in
like
someone
else
suggested
and
do
this
repeatedly
until
mgmt
stops
locking
the
door
so
yes
dogs
locked
all
day
have
tried
to
arrange
a
viewing
w
the
management
company
but
now
they
want
me
to
do
this
every
month
and
have
to
stay
home
to
wait
for
ng
to
be
able
to
call
management
to
tell
them
they
are
here
b
it
seems
like
i
am
the
only
phone
contact
between
anyone
also
a
year
and
a
half
ago
i
had
ng
come
in
and
they
upgraded
our
meters
and
up
until
november
of
last
year
l
things
were
fine
any
who
thanks
for
the
comments
opinions
and
advice
the
day
has
started
to
you
and
yours
it
is
a
wall
built
by
management
with
on
created
door
and
one
combination
lock
my
mother
lived
alone
in
a
3
bedroom
house
practically
never
using
heat
just
electric
blankets
and
they
estimated
her
gas
bill
as
if
it
was
a
family
of
6
cranking
the
heat
all
winter
and
doing
hundreds
of
loads
of
laundry
estimates
magically
are
always
over
why
would
that
be
i
wonder
agreed
and
even
had
they
gone
up
an
estimation
is
still
just
that
no
one
can
actually
tell
me
what
i
truly
owe
if
the
3rd
floor
is
the
top
floor
it
is
very
realistic
that
nearly
all
of
their
needed
heat
is
coming
up
from
below
and
they
need
almost
never
turn
on
the
heat
source
i
have
an
attic
office
with
its
own
heat
zone
and
that
thermostat
is
never
on
and
i
almost
always
am
in
shorts
because
it
s
78
degrees
up
here
especially
in
winter
i
used
to
use
a
laptop
and
sdr
software
and
dongle
to
read
my
meters
always
was
accurate
to
the
bills
not
necessarily
in
my
apt
the
gas
is
heating
and
hot
water
only
april
through
october
the
gas
bill
is
average
of
5
a
month
only
when
heating
is
it
substantially
more
then
it
s
around
20
a
month
careful
i
think
we
have
an
external
shut
off
yeah
i
really
do
feel
burned
out
by
this
i
never
thought
of
putting
the
money
aside
and
not
paying
sounds
stupid
now
i
always
just
went
automode
on
bill
payments
past
trauma
issues
thank
you
for
this
i
am
going
to
immediately
put
this
into
practice
like
the
idea
of
an
escrow
account
thank
you
i
finally
broke
down
and
did
that
yesterday
i
am
grateful
for
the
confirmation
that
this
might
help
this
is
where
you
need
to
tell
national
grid
that
you
believe
you
have
illegaly
shared
utilities
i
m
with
you
can
you
imagine
someone
locking
op
in
the
bathroom
for
6
hours
every
day
that
s
1
2
the
time
these
dogs
are
spent
in
their
crate
confine
them
to
a
bedroom
if
her
management
company
is
really
entering
illegally
but
i
highly
doubt
that
is
happening
because
it
s
illegal
if
the
answer
is
yes
they
should
get
a
cat
no
way
to
treat
a
dog
yes
because
i
have
caught
them
on
camera
trying
to
break
into
my
outside
porch
door
before
and
kinda
hard
to
act
like
it
was
an
accident
i
am
the
last
apartment
on
the
3rd
floor
there
is
no
one
after
my
door
to
confuse
it
for
they
re
reasoning
they
thought
it
was
my
neighbor
s
door
like
i
said
not
as
slick
as
they
think
sometimes
once
is
all
you
need
if
it
looks
like
the
neighbor
s
unit
was
connected
to
yours
illegally
your
landlord
might
face
consequences
enough
that
they
have
to
fix
it
even
if
that
isn
t
the
case
and
the
estimates
have
been
high
your
bill
will
be
adjusted
and
if
you
re
overpaid
as
much
as
you
think
it
might
be
enough
to
cover
the
next
few
months
of
use
in
credit
and
if
it
s
a
cheap
padlock
i
d
be
looking
into
a
lockpick
set
but
that
s
definitely
illegal
and
i
m
funny
of
bad
ideas
speaking
of
any
of
those
small
basement
windows
on
the
gas
meter
side
depending
on
age
they
can
be
incredibly
easy
to
open
with
a
credit
card
also
definitely
illegal
and
you
will
definitely
need
an
accomplice
to
help
get
you
in
and
back
out
again
40
month
for
2
people
showering
and
cooking
and
washing
dishes
sounds
about
right
to
me
camera
at
the
door
guy
on
yt
shows
how
to
pick
most
common
locks
in
about
60
sec
even
combo
locks
i
think
i
drive
my
wife
crazy
but
i
always
check
the
bills
for
the
actual
documented
usage
and
monitor
the
numbers
on
the
meters
too
i
definitely
don
t
trust
estimates
either
especially
over
time
it
s
inexcusable
that
a
utility
can
bill
estimates
for
that
long
with
no
justification
for
it
yep
i
own
a
duplex
with
2br
apts
both
units
gas
bills
are
about
15
during
the
summer
let
the
property
manager
and
national
grid
fight
it
out
it
could
take
weeks
or
months
to
get
access
just
be
prepared
when
the
shutoff
happens
cats
shouldn
t
be
locked
up
in
a
crate
all
day
either
this
is
your
concern
priorities
my
friend
and
they
are
crates
because
my
management
company
has
on
more
then
one
occasion
threatened
with
just
coming
into
my
home
i
do
not
want
my
dogs
nor
their
people
to
get
hurt
but
sure
let
s
focus
on
getting
a
cat
and
you
think
the
solution
is
to
abuse
them
keeping
them
locked
up
all
day
might
be
legal
but
it
s
immoral
what
kind
of
person
are
you
that
you
think
this
is
okay
why
even
have
pets
with
you
re
going
to
treat
them
like
crap
poor
dog
would
you
want
to
be
in
a
cage
for
12
hours
who
cares
about
a
20
utility
bill
get
a
fucking
dog
walker
edit
dogs
you
re
mistreating
2
dogs
would
that
be
for
cooking
for
every
night
we
cook
about
once
maybe
twice
a
week
our
son
passed
4
years
ago
this
may
cooking
isn
t
really
a
thing
for
us
any
more
we
do
still
cook
but
not
like
that
most
of
the
food
we
buy
is
for
the
dogs
we
keep
them
on
a
fresh
food
diet
no
no
camera
i
m
so
proud
of
you
guys
sometimes
i
m
glad
i
m
not
the
only
one
who
s
immediate
first
thought
was
just
pick
break
off
the
lock
they
can
t
shut
it
off
because
they
can
t
access
the
meter
cats
usually
roam
a
pee
in
a
litter
box
massachusetts
law
requires
prior
notice
for
apt
entry
and
then
only
for
specific
situations
stated
in
the
law
don
t
put
up
with
that
bs
send
them
a
cease
and
desist
letter
thank
you
we
both
work
in
the
food
industry
together
so
we
mostly
end
up
eating
work
cooking
is
a
tiny
fraction
compared
to
hot
water
usually
i
suspect
40
is
correct
but
you
could
confirm
no
hot
water
is
dripping
from
bath
shower
sinks
bolt
cutters
are
much
easier
given
it
s
a
combination
lock
tell
the
building
management
they
can
give
you
the
combo
or
you
ll
cut
it
off
replace
it
and
give
them
the
new
combo
forget
99
of
your
ranting
the
way
a
lot
of
it
reads
isn
t
helping
you
you
need
a
live
reading
of
the
meter
that
s
all
that
matters
not
break
but
15
on
amazon
and
you
can
be
exploring
most
locked
places
in
about
a
min
and
there
goes
the
third
tumbler
landlords
are
the
new
land
barrons
so
this
is
the
best
part
they
will
make
the
property
manager
remove
any
obstruction
and
might
even
need
to
obtain
a
court
order
to
do
so
it
will
go
on
for
months
yes
they
like
to
roam
around
the
house
they
shouldn
t
be
locked
up
in
a
cage
all
day
long
i
have
drafted
one
up
and
am
getting
it
certified
mailed
to
their
office
so
someone
has
to
sign
for
it
but
this
is
a
deeper
problem
then
just
the
gas
those
issues
i
am
handling
including
acting
responsibly
and
making
sure
my
animals
and
whatever
idiots
who
don
t
care
are
protected
by
crating
my
dogs
unfortunately
all
it
takes
is
for
them
to
just
be
stupid
think
they
won
t
be
caught
as
they
have
proven
they
really
think
they
are
that
slick
and
come
into
my
chome
anyways
now
they
are
hurt
my
dogs
are
hurt
possibly
worse
and
i
run
the
risk
of
losing
my
dogs
if
something
happens
because
of
them
breaking
the
law
and
like
most
crimes
nothing
can
be
done
til
it
s
done
my
dogs
are
not
worth
that
this
post
is
to
see
if
there
is
any
advice
or
situation
i
may
have
missed
doing
this
on
my
own
not
for
judgment
again
just
keep
that
to
yourself
no
one
cares
but
if
you
can
help
my
family
then
this
is
who
i
am
speaking
to
looking
for
guidance
from
no
they
are
not
all
common
combo
locks
can
be
picked
with
15
of
tools
and
15
min
of
video
bolt
cutters
are
big
depending
the
lock
you
may
need
very
big
ones
and
they
require
some
decent
strength
and
you
look
sus
carrying
them
around
whereas
picks
can
be
in
your
back
pocket
finally
you
can
pick
the
lock
explore
and
put
it
back
and
no
one
will
ever
know
a
few
days
after
the
certified
letter
send
a
copy
regular
first
class
mail
sometimes
shady
operations
won
t
sign
for
certified
and
a
few
weeks
later
it
s
returned
to
sender
track
it
every
day
on
postal
website
with
that
certified
number
once
it
shows
delivery
print
that
page
and
save
as
a
pdf
1
bolt
cutters
are
absolutely
easier
no
matter
how
much
lpl
you
ve
watched
2
conspicuously
destroying
the
existing
lock
with
plenty
of
legal
justification
to
do
so
is
half
the
point
the
tools
replacement
lock
and
or
call
to
a
locksmith
and
or
plumber
are
all
deductible
from
rent
as
the
property
management
failed
to
even
inspect
for
necessary
repairs
much
less
make
them
or
provide
access
for
inspection
and
repair
that
is
of
course
assuming
enough
of
op
s
story
is
close
enough
to
the
whole
truth
which
is
admittedly
a
pretty
big
assumption
lol
what
about
no
tools
and
4
8
tries
i
can
do
this
with
zero
practice
and
get
most
locks
in
about
5
min

police
i
saw
this
article
earlier
today
and
it
didn
t
even
answer
their
own
question
really
i
think
it
s
dumb
something
small
like
a
parade
is
one
thing
but
driving
around
like
this
all
the
time
just
seems
like
a
distraction
what
happened
to
a
wreath
on
the
front
of
your
truck
being
enough
assuming
we
ever
get
a
fair
amount
of
snow
it
s
going
to
be
a
motherfucker
clearing
the
snow
off
if
he
leaves
those
on
serious
question
is
this
street
legal
i
saw
a
car
like
this
at
night
and
it
was
incredibly
distracting
on
the
road
the
best
part
of
this
is
all
the
drivers
discovering
that
their
paint
is
being
scratched
by
the
bulbs
moving
around
the
videos
circulating
online
of
people
being
like
omg
my
car
are
priceless
is
this
in
plymouth
carver
per
chance
they
ve
been
slowly
traveling
north
like
killer
bees
they
ve
finally
reached
us
as
with
all
trends
in
this
day
and
age
it
most
likely
originated
by
some
idiot
on
tiktok
and
the
sheep
follow
along
you
know
on
rainy
nights
when
light
is
bouncing
all
over
the
place
and
it
can
be
hard
to
see
in
traffic
it
is
not
fun
to
have
more
distracting
shit
on
the
road
people
are
so
fucking
childish
now
hard
to
see
but
the
car
behind
this
one
also
had
the
lights
on
it
what
s
up
with
dat
maybe
clark
griswold
wants
to
be
more
visible
on
the
road
so
he
doesn
t
accidentally
get
stuck
under
a
truck
if
i
came
across
this
knucklehead
at
night
i
d
probably
end
up
in
a
ditch
or
into
a
telephone
pole
cars
with
those
ultra
intense
purpley
white
colored
headlights
alone
are
bad
enough
there
s
a
pretty
steep
moving
violation
for
doing
this
i
hope
i
mean
i
see
people
driving
around
in
cybertrucks
more
and
more
lately
too
so
i
m
just
assuming
at
this
point
that
our
judgement
and
taste
as
a
society
has
taken
a
big
nosedive
i
blame
the
purge
election
year
movie
for
this
https

a
ozhgch4
there
were
a
few
kids
at
shaw
s
in
medway
the
other
day
making
tiktoks
with
a
bmw
all
festooned
out
like
this
as
well
since
stupidity
started
same
here
new
this
year
very
festive
several
of
these
up
in
fitchburg
area
apparently
it
s
illegal
and
surprise
surprise
it
destroys
your
paint
everyone
is
so
caught
up
in
getting
views
it
s
spewing
into
the
real
world
hey
look
at
me
i
don
t
know
exactly
when
it
became
more
popular
but
led
light
strings
have
certainly
made
it
easier
to
do
dumbest
shit
i
ve
seen
all
week
looks
like
a
scene
out
of
bladerunner
fruitcakes
they
are
against
the
law
thats
why
you
never
see
them
that
s
kind
of
awesome
someone
likely
visited
southeast
asia
and
thought
it
was
ok
to
decorate
their
vehicles
like
it
happens
in
asia
saw
one
this
weekend
in
milwaukee
i
ve
never
seen
that
and
don
t
expect
to
except
online
traffic
karen
subreddit
wasn
t
it
alex
choi
who
started
it
a
few
years
ago
saw
one
in
worcester
a
few
days
ago
i
saw
one
while
nearly
being
run
off
the
road
by
tailgating
assholes
that
don
t
know
what
4ft
to
pass
bikes
means
where
did
you
see
them
i
saw
two
in
new
hampshire
put
your
phone
away
while
driving
goober
it
answered
it
pretty
clearly
in
bold
saying
police
say
driving
with
colorful
lights
is
illegal
or
the
red
nose
and
antlers
those
were
classic
xmas
lights
all
over
the
vehicle
is
the
equivalent
of
the
truck
balls
hitch
people
are
fucktards
who
don
t
care
about
safety
and
motor
vehicle
laws
they
ll
say
it
s
my
car
i
can
do
what
i
want
that
may
be
but
it
s
not
your
highway
and
you
must
meet
the
rules
to
drive
it
on
them
people
over
estimate
what
is
distracting
sure
the
first
time
you
see
it
it
s
a
distraction
but
you
don
t
even
acknowledge
it
by
the
3rd
time
same
with
cars
that
put
a
wreath
on
the
front
car
loaded
with
bumper
stickers
new

people
had
a
meltdown
when

went
into
cars
then
another
meltdown
when
tesla
put
large
screens
in
their
car
they
are
now
basically
standard
feature
in
the
80s
people
would
complain
about

lights
now
cars
are
loaded

what
a
nightmare
i
still
had
a
bike
rack
on
my
roof
when
i
went
up
to
vermont
and
got
a
foot
of
snow
on
thanksgiving
clearing
that
off
was
bad
enough
if
they
re
incandescent
bulbs
they
can
just
melt
the
snow
off
they
re
probably
leds
though
meaning
a
lot
less
heat
output
also
even
if
they
were
incandescent
it
would
still
take
forever
to
actually
melt
the
snow
with
them
lol
it
looks
very
distracting
and
dangerous
no
i
ve
seen
a
beamer
with
these
and
i
m
just
thinking
what
an
idiot
lol
i
m
leasing
a
new
honda
and
i
cannot
even
imagine
heck
i
wouldn
t
do
it
to
my
2015
civic
with
the
shitty
paint
job
lol
i
have
seen
one
like
this
in
seekonk
and
then
a
pick
up
truck
with
christmas
lights
in
attleboro
i
saw
this
in
danvers
ma
super
distracting
and
blinding
to
my
astigmatism
no
i
m
sorry
it
wasn
t
in
plymouth
carver
nah
first
saw
them
in
boston
at
first
night
in
the
1970
s
first
one
i
saw
was
a
vw
bug
me
me
me
look
at
me
i
have
seen
three
different
cars
in
norwood
with
them
this
week
alone
one
of
the
works
for
a
pizza
delivery
the
other
two
were
just
random
i
think
it
s
really
cool
looking
in
real
life
too
i
saw
one
in
connecticut
an
all
white
car
with
multicolored
lights
it
looked
really
cool
however
i
get
the
dangerous
and
why
not
to
do
it
makes
sense
i
only
saw
one
once
now
i
saw
one
on
the
highway
last
weekend
before
they
became
popular
on
reddit
it
was
surprisingly
bight
i
guess
prepare
to
be
surprised
there
s
a
beamer
on
the
north
shore
i
ve
seen
at
least
twice
this
year
saw
one
in
worcester
today
i
had
two
pass
me
tonight
i
saw
it
at
the
intersection
of
summer
school
streets
in
somerville
the
other
night
i
see
one
all
the
time
in
mass
traffic

i
m
hearing
that
white

only
all

the

i
m
sure
they

enforce

just

as
they
do
speeding

red

any

booo
bad

i

not

i
m
travelling
this
isn

the

as
a
wreath
or
bright
flashing
billboards
that
are
positioned
well
outside
the
direct
eye
level
of
drivers
on
the
road
and
those
hid
headlights
are
actually
problematic
for
a
good
number
of
people
i
see
this
as
the
equivalent
of
driving
around
with
high
beams
on
with
4x
the
standard
number
of
headlights
that
can
cause
problems
with
oncoming
traffic
being
able
to
even
see
properly
especially
for
anyone
over
50
or
with
astigmatism
you
re
really
trying
to
say
a
car
completely
covered
in
christmas
lights
is
the
same
as
a
this
car
climbed
mt
washington
sticker
they
likely
had
ppf
last
year
i
saw
an
audi
r8
and
and
porsche
gt3
driving
together
both
lit
up
like
this
i
ended
up
next
to
them
at
a
traffic
light
i
thought
it
was
interesting
i
saw
a
lit
up
pickup
truck
in
woburn
just
a
few
days
ago
rear
facing
white
lights
when
not
backing
up
are
not
legal
there
s
a
catch
all
provision
that
bans
all
aftermarket
lighting
devices
that
don
t
comply
with
federal
mv
safety
regulations
feels
like
all
these
halogen
motherfuckers
already
have
that
going
on
i
can
t
look
directly
at
them
but
i
always
know
they
re
coming
because
it
s
suddenly
daylight
again
as
they
approach
white
is
restricted
to
only
4
visible
from
the
front
must
meet
federal
motor
vehicle
standards
and
of
course
red
and
blue
are
obvious
no
no
s
purple
is
designated
for
hearses
reading
comprehension
is
tough
you
probably
mean
the
leds
halogens
have
been
around
since
the
70s
i
know
i
won
t
hold
it
against
you
though
i
know
a
couple
places
that
help
adults
improve
their
reading
skills
if
you
re
in

i
can
get
their
info
that
s
the

op

it
didn

help
this
person
9
years
since
snowpocalypse
2015
masterfully
immortalized
in
granite
state
of
mind
i
remember
spending
a
week
at
the
hampton
inn
in
dover
like
it
was
just
yesterday
also
will
remember
the
sounds
of
the
ice
warming
up
and
the
trees
cracking
like
glass
wind
chimes
during
an
apocalypse
glad
eversource
got
their
shit
mostly
together
since
then
i
was
16
at
the
time
working
my
first
job
at
burger
king
and
i
remember
for
an
entire
shift
we
had
a
nonstop
line
of
cars
wrapped
around
the
building
because
we
were
one
of
the
only
restaurants
in
the
area
running
on
a
generator
it
was
a
surreal
situation
after
my
shift
i
ended
up
having
my
buddy
rich
sleepover
and
for
some
reason
we
watched
deliverance
on
a
portable
dvd
player
i
didnt
have
power
for
over
2
weeks
had
to
relocate
to
a
hotel
because
of
how
cold
it
got
i
was
working
as
a
residential
electrician
at
the
time
and
business
was
extremely
slow
i
mean
i
was
lucky
if
i
got
20
hours
week
that
ice
storm
triggered
a
run
on
generator
installs
that
absolutely
saved
my
ass
during
that
recession
i
was
a
fedex
driver
at
the
time
my
very
first
route
almost
died
when
a
tree
snapped
off
and
landed
about
10
feet
from
me
cut
up
my
leg
pretty
bad
from
the
ice
shrapnel

took
so
many
pictures
that
morning
crazy
storm
i
lost
a
bunch
of
birch
trees
last
spring
to
the
ice
in
march
april
bent
over
several
one
uprooted
itself
i
had
to
cut
it
because
it
was
nearly
horizontal
laying
across
the
yard
at
least
it
started
growing
back
from
the
8ft
of
trunk
left
i
like
my
birch
trees
but
they
re
slowly
getting
conquered
by
hemlock
that
grows
faster
and
creates
too
much
shade
for
them
to
continue
was
living
in
bennington
on
onset
road
crotched
had
been
closed
for
years
and
the
rent
for
the
trailside
condos
was
too
cheap
to
pass
up
as
i
was
living
with
pain
in
ass
room
mates
at
the
time
i
went
out
on
my
deck
the
morning
after
fired
up
the
fireplace
as
the
power
was
long
out
walked
out
onto
my
deck
beyond
pitchblack
and
took
two
steps
and
performed
a
trick
right
out
of
a
3
stooges
clown
act
my
feet
went
forward
and
up
arms
back
landed
partly
on
my
headhandsass
knocking
the
wind
completely
out
of
me
i
had
unknowingly
walked
out
onto
2
inches
of
ice
with
a
layer
of
mist
melted
standing
water
i
laid
there
for
a
minute
partially
out
of
it
and
listened
to
the
surreal
sound
of
dozens
if
not
hundreds
of
random
full
size
trees
snapping
and
the
loud
echoing
thud
when
they
landed
in
pitch
back
was
surreal
remember
like
it
was
yesterday
also
could
only
head
partially
towards
antrim
as
the
road
was
blocked
towards
francestown
was
blocked
for
a
day
or
two
or
three
was
out
of
work
at
least
a
week
with
no
power
limited
access
out
had
electric
heat
so
had
to
keep
the
fireplace
on
to
keep
the
place
from
going
full
icebox
hope
to
never
see
anything
resembling
that
again
though
live
in
the
southern
most
now
and
more
prepared
for
longterm
outages
i
have
only
been
here
12
years
but
i
heard
about
that
storm
from
neighbors
they
were
out
of
power
for
like
2
weeks
i
didn
t
live
out
here
yet
but
i
remember
hearing
about
it
on
the
news
i
was
working
nights
and
i
swear
all
i
did
was
run
a
snowblower
i
moved
my
mailbox
to
the
back
door
by
the
driveway
so
i
wouldn
t
have
to
shovel
as
much
literally
how
i
remember
what
year
it
was
i
was
visiting
a
friend
from
montana
and
they
asked
what
nh
was
like
had
to
play
granite
state
of
mind
i
went
to
school
with
the
girl
who
sang
in
it
should
ve
converted
all
of
my
savings
to
asplundh
stock
that
morning

it
was
simultaneously
the
most
beautiful
thing
to
see
but
also
the
precursor
to
what
was
the
most
difficult
2
weeks
of
some
of
our
lives
i
still
look
back
on
it
as

so
they
re
only
organized
one
day
a
year
that
explains
a
lot
my
good
friend
s
wife
just
got
elected
she
went
through
a
orientation
and
one
of
the
things
she
talked
about
was
the
license
plates
available
to
state
reps
apparently
there
s
little
to
no
advantage
for
the
reps
to
get
them
they
don
t
get
special
parking
privileges
with
them
i
think
she
said
they
have
a
designated
parking
garage
that
they
don
t
need
the
rep
plates
to
use
and
the
reps
have
to
pay
for
the
license
plate
so
it
s
basically
a
vanity
plate
to
stroke
egos
hehehe
that
s
on
brand
the
legislators
already
have
plates
why
should
the
taxpayers
pay
to
replace
them
it
d
be
wasteful
spending

we
tried

three

on

but
it
failed
the
three
times
but
they
took
the
money
out
of
our
checking
account
three
times
so
i
called
them
and
made
a
fourth
payment
over
the

and
they
said
that
the
other
payments
would
get
reversed
eventually
if
i
go
through
a

i
make
a
note
of
it
as

15
minutes
lol
wtf
does
this
say
lol
that
actually
happens
more

the

it
s
a

we
d
have
plenty
of

capacity
which
massachusetts
would
be
happy
to
buy
they
are
paying
through

nose
for

right
now
100
sick

keeping

option
they
should
build

according

it
also
provides

at

time
to
build
reactor
two
at
seabrook
dude
nh
is
perfect
for
nuclear
through
its
entire
lifecycle
when
it
comes
time
to
store
the
spent
fuel
we
can
bury
it
deep
in
the
granite
bedrock
nh
has
always
been
a
viable
option
for
spent
nuclear
waste
storage
we
could
even
charge
other
states
to
store
their
waste
it
would
probably
cost
10
20b
and
10
15
years
i
d
love
to
see
it
but
i
don
t
think
most
of
the
public
would
be
on
board
especially
since
the
power
companies
would
be
passing
200
of
the
cost
to
the
consumers
per
usual
nuclear
and
nat
l
gas
this
is
the
way
dumbest
thing
ever
done
regarding
local
electric
infrastructure
was
not
finishing
it
back
then
i
remember
arguing
with
a
hs
teacher
who
was
one
of
the
clamshell
alliance
nutjobs
about
this
seabrook
station
had
an
estimated
build
cost
of
under
1
billion
after
reactor
1
was
finished
almost
2
decades
later
it
had
cost
almost
18
billion
it
completely
bankrupted
psnh
the
plant
is
not
locally
owned
anymore
because
of
that
nuclear
power
is
clean
efficient
and
safe
energy
but
it
is
a
massive
money
pit
it
s
never
happening
i
was
just
thinking
something
along
these
lines
allegedly
ma
me
vt
and
ct
have
moratoriums
on
any
nuclear
building
the
sooner
we
start
the
sooner
we
shore
up
our
energy
costs
and
capitalize
on
the
states
around
us
who
need
electricity
but
wont
build
it
should
have
been
built
back
in
the
70s
as
plannned
long
overdue
hampton
need
to
lower
their
fuckin
property
taxes
for
fuck
sake
they
went
up
110
this
year
alone
i
was
just
talking
to
someone
about
this
apparently
we
have
had
the
technology
to
recycle
radioactive
waste
and
reuse
it
since
the
50s
but
global
politics
got
in
the
way
now
10
counties
do
it
and
the
waste
is
only
bad
for
200
years
instead
of
1000
s
also
we
have
150
years
worth
of
nuclear
waste
energy
just
sitting
that
could
power
the
entire
country
seems
like
a
no
brainer
it
s
long
overdue
build
it
we
would
have
built
the
2nd
reactor
but
climate
activists
and
dukakis
delayed
the
construction
of
reactor
1
to
the
point
that
reactor
2
was
economically
infeasible
at
the
time
i
am
fairly
pro
nuclear
but
it
s
worth
looking
into
the
children
cancer
spikes
in
the
area
seriously
look
it
up
it
even
made
the
news
awhile
back
and
i
know
one
of
the
families
affected
by
it
ok
so
go
build
it
yes
make
swimming
year
round
in
the
ocean
possible
so
you
want
to
move
everything
that
s
happening
in
nj
to
seabrook
ok
um
no
definitely
not
i
thought
the
push
to
nuclear
slowed
down
because
of
accidents
like
chernobyl
and
three
mile
island
sick
of
big
oil
liars
yes
it
was
big
oil
that
caused
the
cost
runups
on
reactor
i
lol
lobbyists
commissions
attorneys
and
capitalists
what
could
possibly
go
wrong
with
that
concoction
s
doesn
t
that
water
disburse
miles
out
i
always
found
that
aspect
of
the
plant
interesting
you
serious
i
haven
t
been
down
there
so
don
t
know
it
s
layout
nuclear
waste
is
totally
fine
to
be
stored
on
site
the
only
real
issue
is
what
to
do
if
the
reactor
site
is
ever
totally
decommissioned
it
doesn
t
have
to
or
if
it
does
that
may
may
be
the
place
where
the
learning
happens
for
other
sites
we
need
to
do
it
at
some
point
nuclear
is
non
negotiable
if
we
want
to
deal
with
climate
change
without
causing
a
global
contraction
on
the
scale
of
the
black
death
in
europe
might
as
well
be
here
why
not
make
microsoft
amazon
and
google
nvidia
pay
for
it
let
s
ignore
the
big
ball
of
sun
in
the
sky
giving
us
energy
edit
corrective
any
one
thing
not
that
it
will
change
the
mind
of
the
witless
downvoters
original
along
with
the
old
hat
stuff
wood
coal
etc
no
need
to
go
all
in
on
anything
reactor
1
and
2
was
hobbled
by
the
clamshell
alliance
and
organized
protestors
obviously
this
drove
up
costs
probably
a
lot
one
could
hope
this
wouldn
t
happen
again
but
who
knows
generally
i
think
the
social
activist
types
appreciate
nuclear
more
nowadays
but
i
m
not
sure
but
it
is
a
massive
money
pit
you
mean
just
like
cape
wind
at
least
we
know
we
d
get
reliable
electricity
whose
rates
would
be
more
stable
we
can
t
say
the
same
for
cape
wind
which
has
a
nasty
habit
of
killing
right
whales
and
destroying
the
ocean
s
ecosystem
that
s
always
the
argument
and
i
ve
never
heard
a
good
comeback
for
it
the
energy
generation
space
is
rapidly
evolving
and
power
plants
are
funded
by
private
enterprise
for
the
most
part
when
people
invest
money
they
want
a
stable
return
on
their
investment
any
plans
for
energy
generation
in
a
volatile
space
need
to
show
quick
returns
not
returns
10
years
out
in
a
quickly
changing
sector
where
you
might
build
a
plant
at
massive
cost
and
then
find
out
that
some
other
technology
has
undercut
you
on
a
per
kwh
basis
if
modular
nuclear
every
really
becomes
financially
viable
it
will
provide
giant
returns
in
a
small
footprint
but
i
haven
t
seen
any
manufacturers
that
can
yet
provide
a
quick
return
on
such
a
large
investment
it
s
getting
closer
but
still
not
there
the
uk
has
plans
to
deploy
mini
nuclear
all
over
the
country
by
the
early
2030
s
but
they
don
t
get
the
sunlight
that
we
do
the
levelized
cost
of
energy
even
without
subsidies
is
still
favoring
solar
battery
and
to
a
lesser
extent
these
days
wind
it
can
be
deployed
quickly
and
cheaply
and
if
you
can
get
the
transmission
to
lesser
served
areas
of
the
country
that
s
going
to
be
key
people
say
well
if
business
won
t
invest
in
nuclear
government
should
to
which
i
ask
why
should
taxpayer
money
be
invested
in
areas
that
business
has
already
determined
is
a
bad
or
risky
investment
care
to
elaborate
indeed
it
did
remember
it
well
scary
times
also
the
problem
of
where
to
store
the
spent
fuel
as
everyone
went
nimby
on
the
issue
will
be
of
concern
if
a
second
reactor
is
opened
local
control
as
always
is
a
legit
issue
as
well
as
it
is
majority
owned
by
a
florida
firm
and
a
smaller
part
by
a
massachusetts
wholesale
power
broker
i
remember
when
governor
meldrim
thompson
advocated
for
the
plant
by
saying
it
would
make
electricty
too
cheap
to
meter
god
what
naivet
yes
in
the
ocean
the
warm
water
attracts
fish
and
you
ll
see
people
fishing
the
outlets
off
hampton
warm
water
discharge
does
attract
fish
when
visiting
florida
we
toured
a
popular
spot
for
manatee
watching
it
was
right
next
to
a
power
plant
dont
give
nvidia
any
more
excuses
to
raise
prices
5060ti
for
1200
incoming
because
they
re
too
busy
scooping
up
coal
plants
next
to
the
poors
in
flyover
states
coal
plants
that
were
supposed
to
be
decommissioned
you
can
add
power
to
the
network
via
solar
but
you
still
need
something
to
carry
the
load
at
night
or
during
days
where
the
sun
is
obscured
nuclear
is
ideal
for
that
totes
ignore
it
also
the
air
moving
at
speed
across
certain
parts
of
the
north
country
or
even
tidal
pots
catching
currents
it
s
not
as
if
the
second
fastest
navigable
tide
in
north
america
is
in
the
river
that
separates
maine
from
n
h
naah
ignore
the
lot
diversification
is
almost
always
a
good
idea
coal
ugh
you
don
t
wanna
live
downwind
of
that
shit
nasty
like
the
newington
schiller
station
used
to
be
only
on
steroids
and
that
place
was
notorious
for
fouling
the
air
on
the
maine
side
and
even
the
oil
tankers
coming
in
to
port
and
unloading
would
cause
issues
was
working
grounds
back
in
1988
at
spinnaker
point
the
old
seacrest
village
and
the
black
liquor
fuel
oil
was
being
offloaded
at
the
station
and
the
fumes
caught
in
the
lee
side
of
the
hill
we
were
mowing
on
and
one
of
the
kids
on
the
riding
mower
was
overcome
and
fainted
from
the
combination
of
stink
and
heat
let
s
not
even
get
into
the
plant
exhaust
making
portsmouth
and
newington
hellish
when
there
was
a
thermal
inversion
of
air
over
great
bay
seriously
it
was
a
close
up
the
house
and
leave
for
the
day
type
thing
as
the
air
got
to
the
quality
of
being
downwind
from
the
biggest
truck
stop
in
the
world
and
the
shiller
station
was
oil
and
a
fuckton
cleaner
than
coal
naah
fuck
coal
man
this
ain
t
the
19th
century
there
s
too
much
nastiness
already
in
the
mix
to
have
that
be
used
today
we
ve
got
better
options
i
mean
it
absolutely
would
reality
is
that
we
need
to
remove
a
lot
of
the
tools
obstructionist
nimbys
use
to
stop
development
of
necessary
infrastructure
but
then
you
d
also
have
stuff
like
northern
pass
which
people
here
seem
to
hate
so
yoi
see
why
it
persists
nobody
s
willing
to
give
up
a
heckler
s
veto
and
that
means
that
nothing
gets
done
all
good
points
but
you
re
missing
the
biggum
it
is
nh
law
that
the
cost
of
the
plant
construction
will
not
be
passed
on
to
nh
residents
utility
companies
will
not
invest
their
own
money
into
new
infrastructure
unless
municipalities
or
taxpayers
foot
the
bill
that
law
sealed
reactor
2
s
fate
it
s
just
not
happening
wait
until
the
tidal
power
generation
is
perfected
something
tells
me
climate
change
polar
melting
will
be
long
forgotten
when
that
train
gets
rolling
uap
s
tend
to
have
an
interest
in
nuclear
activities
it
was
just
a
joke
really
but
there
s
some
weird
stuff
going
on
in
nj
that
the
government
and
military
has
admitted
is
strange
and
unknown
but
nuclear
activity
could
possibly
bring
something
weird
like
that
to
our
area
right
on
might
be
the
move
next
sunny
sunday
lol
you
ain
t
incorrect
naturally
but
the
load
at
night
is
much
less
point
being
solar
is
a
huge
part
of
our
energy
future
and
cheaper
than
every
alternative
i
didn
t
know
that
actually
the
law
could
be
changed
but
we
could
also
have
legal
weed
right
now
and
we
know
how
that
went
i
also
don
t
know
how
long
it
would
really
take
for
reactor
2
to
pay
for
itself
but
its
almost
definitely
longer
than
power
companies
would
want
to
wait
i
just
appreciate
the
reliability
and
sustainability
of
nuclear
power
so
i
m
disheartened
to
see
the
second
pad
sitting
idle
utility
companies
will
not
invest
their
own
money
into
new
infrastructure
unless
municipalities
or
taxpayers
foot
the
bill
yup
which
leads
to
the
question
why
should
we
invest
taxpayer
money
in
a
project
where
business
has
already
determined
is
a
bad
investment
when
there
are
other
options
i
like
the
idea
of
tidal
power
but
i
don
t
think
it
s
scalable
there
are
towns
distilleries
in
scotland
that
use
tidal
power
i
love
the
idea
of
my
scotch
being
made
w
tidal
power
however
we
are
talking
scotland
and
small
towns
i
don
t
think
it
can
be
ramped
up
for
the
energy
demands
of
new
england
or
nh
for
that
matter
i
could
be
wrong
tho
i
have
seen
some
crazy
hairstyles
here
and
there
but
i
have
never
seen
this
one
before
the
real
crime
is
that

you
know
i
am
really
offended
by
that
statue
of
that
poor
baby
surrounded
by
those
scary
men
if
everyone
can
t
exercise
their
rights
then
no
one
should
be
able
to
the
city
of
concord
code
department
manager
is
bigoted
and
a
liability
to
the
city
who
has
hurt
the
city
significantly
since
about
2022
single
handedly
drove
the
fair
and
even
handed
employees
out
of
the
office
and
exposed
the
city
to
at
least
one
potential
lawsuit
i
m
not
surprised
that
he
continues
to
fail
the
people
of
concord
i
m
just
disappointed
that
the
city
manager
didn
t
fire
him
when
given
cause
tst
does
some
good
community
outreach
work
specifically
with
ther
sober
faction
meetings
i
ve
been
a
member
for
quite
some
time
the
intolerance
of
christianity
who
s
entire
new
testament
is
supposed
to
be
based
around
this
jesus
guy
teaching
everyone
love
and
tolerance
has
been
lost
on
many
especially
christians
so
we
have
a
display
preaching
tolerance
disguised
as
something
people
don
t
like
to
tolerate
and
it
gets
destroyed
and
the
mayor
s
response
is
basically
i
didn
t
even
want
it
here
to
begin
with
honestly
this
sounds
exactly
like
the
kind
of
attention
the
temple
loves
irony
contradiction
and
intolerance
oh
look
a
paywall
mark
my
word
if
and
when
these
preachers
get
control
of
the
republican
party
and
they
re
sure
trying
to
do
so
it
s
going
to
be
a
terrible
damn
problem
frankly
these
people
frighten
me
politics
and
governing
demand
compromise
but
these
christians
believe
they
are
acting
in
the
name
of
god
so
they
can
t
and
won
t
compromise
i
know
i
ve
tried
to
deal
with
them

read

the
voluptuous

the
cruel
and
torturous
executions
the
unrelenting
vindictiveness
with
which
more
than
half
the
bible
is
filled
it
would
be
more
consistent
that
we
called
it
the
word
of
a
demon
than
the
word
of
god
it
is
a
history
of
wickedness
that
has
served
to
corrupt
and
brutalize
mankind
and
for
my
part
i
sincerely
detest
it
as
i
detest

that
is
cruel
thomas
paine
the
age
of
reason
it
s
a
terrifying
thought
especially
for
someone
entrenched
in
religion
that
a
possibility
exists
where
the
devil
impersonated
god
and
the
bible
is
his
word
and
not
the
lord
s
and
that
by
following
the
bible
we
follow

witches
i
oppose
the

because
i
believe
the
request
was
made
not
in
the
interest
of
promoting
religious
equity
but
in
order
to
drive
an
anti
religious
agenda
as
opposed
to
those
designed
to
promote
an
exclusionary
religious

no

that

aside
what

in

and
it
s
a
shame
people
don
t
give
it
more
thought
instead
of
just
making

so
according
to

maybe

the
people
who
did
that
are
pathetic
damn
i
hope
tst
gets
a

put

to
remove
the

in

if
the

doesn

like
the
baphomet
display
it
d
be
preferred
to
not
promote
any
single
religion
and
stay
secular
as
the

should
be
removed
by
reddit
time
to

destroyed
by
either
sincerely

or

i
mean
it
s
pretty
dang
christian
iirc
i
don
t
think
that
christians
would
enjoy
being
referred
to
as
occultists
not
surprised
but
disappointed
so
if
you
re
po
d
you
should
definitely
do
the
same
to
every
other
religious
or
political
statement
you
see
erected
the
closer
to
the
capital
the
better
it
puts
them
on
the
defense
have
fun
minions
all
religion
create
conflict
maybe
people
need
to
stop
believing
in
fairy

shit
christians
are
so
weak
and
pathetic
religious
tolerance
for
me
not
for
thee
if
one
is
vandalized
they
should
all
be
removed
until
it
is
replaced
just
keep
putting
it
back
bigger
every
time
they
can
t
handle
religious
freedom
dumb
question
is
baphomet
even
in
any
translation
of
the
bible
the
greatest
trick
the
devil
ever
pulled
was
to
convince
the
world
he
doesn
t
exist
good
the
only
people
who
deserve
imaginary
friends
are
the
good
christians
of
this
world
sounds
like
an
invite
what
a
bunch
of
god
fearing
babies
grow
up
removed
that
didn
t
take
long
lol
again
if
this
is
the
church
of
satan
they
pay
their
federal
taxes
so
i
hope
the
police
who
get
money
from
them
do
their
job
when
i
drove
by
it
i
thought
it
was
a
pro
thin
blue
line
statement
due
to
the

and
color
scheme
damn
they
are
big
upset
big

i
m
gonna
go
out
to
big
lots
next
halloween
and
buy
seven
distribute
some
christmas
cheer
to
all
the
surrounding
red
villages
religious
freedom
means
your
freedom
to
spread
an
anti
religious
message
i
had
been
planning
to
visit
concord
to
see
the
statue
and
pay
custom
to
local
businesses
while
i
was
there
guess
i
ll
just
have
to
find
some
nativity
displays
to
fuck
up
since
i
guess
they
re
ok
with
vandalism
lmao
based
please
someone
go
decap
baby
jesus
why
are
people
saying
it
was
christians
or
some
religious
people
destroyed
it
chances
are
it
was
some
drunks
from
a
local
bar
walking
past
it
or
kids
part
of
me
thinks
they
were
hoping
this
would
happen
so
they
could
cry
foul
they
were
hoping
to
get
a
reaction
by
placing
it
and
then
act
surprised
when
a
goofy
statue
got
a
reaction
then
all
cult
displays
must
be
removed
tst
doesn
t
even
worship
or
even
believe
in
satan
which
is
whats
funny
but
satan
is
in
the
name
buddy
you
ll
shit
bricks
when
you
find
out
that
a
titmouse
is
neither
of
those
things
so
the
satanic
temple
has
arguably
done
more
for
abortion
rights
than
planned
parenthood
they
re
truly
great
people
and
the
best
trolls
against
religion
in
our
government
and
schools
if
people
actually
read
up
on
them
they
would
find
a
lot
of

to

really
don

about
this
at

not
even
a
little
this
was
a
setup
with

read
inviting
the
satanic
cult
to
put
up
a
display
conveniently
she
was
also
quickly
interviewed
after
the

attack
good
why
would
a
nh
state
rep
invite
a
group
from
out
of
state
byr
lol
listen
man
calling
themselves
the
satanic
temple
is
just
obviously
a
complete
and
direct
provocation
to
religious
people
the
whole
point
is
to
make
religious
people
mad
and
now
people
are
surprised
when
religious
people
get
mad
and
vandalize
the
satanic
cardboard
cut
out
i
would
literally
expect
this
from
any
person
or
group
the
whole
point
was
to
provoke
this
good
riddance
they
only
do
this
to
make
trouble
christmas
is
a
christian
holiday
their
goat
demon
thing
i
m
sure
doesn
t
have
a
special
day
in
december
it
s
just
an
attention
grab
and
before
anyone
jumps
to
conclusions
i
m
not
religious
while
i
believe
in
and
support
their
right
to
religious
freedoms
i
hate
the
cornballs
at
the
satanic
temple
and
i
m
so
glad
this
happened
if
they
didn
t
do
it
themselves
to
fabricate
controversy
he
says
this
is
a
national
group
extorting
at
the
expense
of
the
local
community
gee
it
sounds
like
civil
rights
in
the
days
of
jim
crow
and
white
southerners
in
charge
complaining
those
nasty
people
from
the
north
coming
in
here
in
meddling
in
our
business
to
change
the
way
we
see
things
what
do
you
know
those
goddamn
liberals
with
an

this
is
how
the
world
changes
for

better
why
do
these
whackos
want
to
ruin
traditional
normal
things
it
s
annoying
god
can
these
satanist
grow
up
its
so
cringey
it
blows
my
mind
that
theres
still
a
community
of
people
doing
the
unironic
satanist
or
flying
spaghetti
monster
shit
begging
them
to
get
a
real
hobby
and
stop
wasting
resources
based
state
rep
ellen
read
d
newmarket
first
invited
the
salem
mass
based
organization
to
bring
its
display
to
provide
a
celebration
of
secularism
to
balance
off
the
religious
holiday
showings
i
am
in
now
way
religious
but
ellen
sounds
like
a
real
bozo
talk
about
a
solution
to
a
problem
no
one
had
good
did
he
say
that
flat
earthers
are
a
religion
exactly
and
the
assertion
that
the
temple
doesn
t
represent
a
religion
cracks
me
up
too
because
the
state
is
supposed
to
be
independent
of
religion
so
if
one
deserves
to
be
at
the
capitol
more
than
the
other
it
would
be
the
so
called
not
religious
temple
and
not
the
clearly
religious
christian
symbol
like
what
preferably
always
the
latter
yep
they
have
tax
exempt
status
they
are
officially
a
religion
unfortunately
christians
are
all
about
freedom
for
themselves
but
no
one
else
this
they
call
mine
a
cult
and
say
i
still
have
to
pay
taxes
even
though
it
s
strictly
forbidden
by
my
goddess
it
does
but
the
tst
is
more
just
a
bunch
of
shit
disturbing
neckbearded
trolls
than
they
are
an
actual
religion
whatever
an
actual
religion
is
defined
as
i
suppose
with
or
without
religion
you
would
have
good
people
doing
good
things
and
evil
people
doing
evil
things
but
for
good
people
to
do
evil
things
that
takes
religion
steven
weinberg
you
realize
that
the
point
of
the
satanic
temple
isn
t
actually
to
worship
satan
but
to
act
as
a
spotlight
to
highlight
religious
impropriety
in
government
the
satanic
temple
knows
their
fictional
character
is
fictional
they
only
have
a
satanic
statue
to
troll
those
who
do
believe
in
fictional
characters
so
you
know
who
did
it
turn
them
in
allegedly
or
it
was
someone
maybe
not
associated
with
tst
but
who
knows
who
did
this
to
get
the
city
to
do
exactly
what
they
re
doing
reconsidering
having
any
outdoor
religious
displays
on
public
property
at
all
statue
is
doing
allot
of
heavy
lifting
it
was
a
mannequin
cancel
culture
except
they
both
symbolize
good
and
evil
to
normal
well
adjusted
people
the
whole
good
is
bad
bad
is
good
thing
is
so
fucked
up
people
can
continue
to
be
fucked
up
and
not
feel
bad
or
need
to
change

which
is

what
tst
wanted
to
get
the
city
to
ban
all
public
displays
including
christian
ones
wouldn
t
be
surprised
if
they
vandalized
it
themselves
this
is
their
schtick
around
christmas
every
year
not
necessarily
in
nh
but
a
vocal
minority
of
them
prefer
the
old
testament
they
want
to
make
their
religion
great
again
so
to
speak
not
just
witches
i
see
your
point
but
anyone
with
any
religious
views
we
are
the
land
of
the
free
freedom
of
religion
i
m
not
a
satanist
and
i
can
tell
you
this
is
wrong
all
the
witches
in
here
giving
some
side
eye
to
whoever
thought
it
was
a
good
idea
to
mess
with
a
statue
of
baphomet
just
no
the
satanic
temple
is
anti
wicca
in
theory
too
many
superstitious
people
with
no
critical
thinking
skills
nothing
is
more
unconstitutional
than
conflating
vandalism
with
terrorism
cuz
satanic
and
temple
are
bad
words
very
bad
words
s
well
the
whole
point
is
to
call
themselves
the
satanic
temple
aka
the
deity
that
represents
evil
and
hatred
in
the
christian
religion
and
then
say
we
believe
in
a
bunch
of
good
stuff
as
if
the
point
of
it
isn
t
to
make
a
bunch
of
christian
s
uncomfortable
and
mad
doesn
t
sound
very
benevolent
to
me
yep
tst
is
recognized
by
the
federal
government
but
they
don
t
fit
his
definition
of
a
religion
lol
there
were
more
than
a
couple
of
posters
in
each
of
those
threads
that
were
promising
hoping
for
vandalism
lol
looking
back
at
our
history
together
we
both
know
you
re
the
one
throwing
tantrums
i
m
living
rent
free
in
your
head
thanks
for
bringing
joy
to
me
during
this
season
of
giving
i
also
haven
t
given
a
care
to
this
statue
being
put
up
or
its
demise
thought
it
was
pretty
great
it
went
through
the
process
and
got
approval
the
thing
about
tst
is
they
don
t
worship
or
even
believe
in
an
actual
satan
it
s
really
all
about
promoting
humanistic
beliefs
and
critical
thinking
the
satan
thing
is
an
example
of
irony
that
should
give
them
the
same
rights
as
other
religions
when
it
comes
to
public
visibility
sounds
like
your
horribly
misinformed
the
satanic
temple
is
an
amazing
organization
the
organization
s
mission
encourages
benevolence

i
prefer

little

cheesus
myself
way
to
completely
undermine
the
severity
of
actual
hate
crimes
to
do
an
epic
own
of
le
stupid
religion
believers
against
a
fake
religion
whose
purpose
is
to
mock
people
of
faith
especially
christians
certainly
not
a
hate
crime
don
t
be
silly
the
government
only
calls
things
a
hate
crime
if
the
victim
is
a
jew
or
a
homosexual
those
baby
jesus
figures
light
up
pretty
quickly
just
saying
in
the
old
days
people
would
steal
baby
jesus
if
i
still
lived
anywhere
nearby
id
gladly
store
the
nativity
scene
for
the
rest
of
the
season
just
steal
it
no
damage
just
relocated
yeah
because
we
want
our
kids
worshipping
fuckin
baphomet
or
doing
drugs
and
having
tons
of
sex
because
well
god
isn
t
real
because
that
s
exactly
where
society
is
going
this
is
probably
why
it
got
destroyed
it
s
only
fair
for
all
the
religious
iconography
to
be
equally
vandalized
the
figure
is
of
baphomet
not
satan
nope
it
was
fabricated
to
persecute
the
knights
templar
by
king
phillip
iv
during
the
inquisitions
of
french
templar
s
he
accused
the
templar
of
worshipping
baphomet
as
a
deity
the
history
of
baphomet
and
what
happened
in
concord
should
make
why
satanists
use
baphomet
as
a
symbol
glaringly
obvious
removed
your
comment
was
removed
for
not
following
reddiquette
it
is
the
satanic
temple
the
mayor
is
the
one
spreading
this
anti
religious
rhetoric
tst
is
an
officially
recognized
religion
with
congregations
all
over
the
world
that
directly
assists
their
communities
fundraise
for
charities
and
even
hold
satanic
religious
services
we
are
no
less
a
religion
than
christianity
nice
crech
you
have
there
would
be
a
shame
if
something
happened
to
it
you
know
a
bunch
of
these
satanist
bad
people
would
lose
their
shit
if
someone
destroyed
the
nativity
scene
go
check
out
the
christian
response
to
the
movie
wicked
and
see
why
so
many
of
us
think
so
haha
i
m
so
glad
someone
else
said
this
as
someone
who
use
to
frequent
the
bars
of
concord
thankfully
that
life
is
over
lol
i
would
put
money
down
that
it
was
drunk
regulars
being
idiots
that
s
what
the
mayor
is
saying
no
displays
at
all
this
is
the
united
states
of
america
kings
have
no
place
here
we
re
not
but
who
do
you
think
the
satanic
church
is
mocking
yeah
who
cares
about
religious
intolerance
you
re
calling
the
people
who
left
the
nativity
scene
alone
a
cult
why
would
a
satanist
vandalize
their
own
display
what
s
your
issue
with
freedom
of
speech
where
was
the
christian
display
sourced
from
i
ll
bet
some
national
grange
funds
went
into
the
budget
for
it
does
freedom
of
religion
not
apply
universally
in
the
us
why
would
the
location
of
their
headquarters
matter
the
satanic
temple
new
hampshire
vermont
is
in
fact
from
new
hampshire
and
vermont
if
somebody
this
easy
to
provoke
into
breaking
the
law
they
aren
t
terribly
tolerant
which
is
rather
the
issue
the
satanic
temple
wants
to
highlight
yeah
it
s
cringy
but
they
have
a
right
to
be
cringe
just
like
christian
fundementalists
do
when
they
shout
at
you
from
the
street
corner
about
going
to
hell
it
s
the
cost
of
a
pluralist
society
get
mad
all
you
want
i
get
mad
every
time
i
turn
on
the
news
but
i
haven
t
hurt
anyone
or
committed
vandalism
yet
so
if
jewish
people
find
a
group
claiming
someone
as
the
son
of
their
god
a
direct
provocation
should
that
group
of
provocateurs
have
their
rights
questioned
is
the
jewish
population
justified
in
destruction
of
christian
displays
this
is
why
we
have
separation
of
church
and
state
let
each
group
put
their
displays
on
private
property
not
our
public
lands
almost
every
aspect
of
the
celebration
of
christmas
is
taken
from
pagan
religions
saturnalia
is
absolutely
a
goat
demon
thing
holiday
in
december
and
it
predates
christmas
i
m
not
religious
either
satanists
celebrate
sol
invictus
on
the
same
day
christians
celebrate
christmas
all
this
hoopla
about
they
don
t
have
a
holiday
in
december
they
re
doing
this
just
for
attention
is
a
load
of
bullshit
name
checks
out
they
crave
attention
so
bad
the
same
guy
who
probably
complains
about
free
speech
derived
from
the
same
fucking
amendment
why
are
they
wackos
just
because
they
are
different
from
you
that
seems
rather
bigoted
don
t
you
think
who
defines
traditional
and
normal
i
don
t
like
different
things
because
they
make
me
uncomfortable
so
they
should
go
away
if
you
want
to
see
a
real
waste
of
time
and
resources
hobby
lobby
got
a
legal
exemption
from
funding
birth
control
on
the
basis
of
demonstrably
fictitious
claims
about
how
birth
control
works
what
do
you
mean
by
unironic
temple
of
satan
promotes
separation
of
church
and
state
something
that
is
necessary
so
long
as
so
many
christians
are
trying
to
legislate
their
beliefs
into
law
and
the
flying
spaghetti
monster
is
and
always
has
been
a
joke
meant
to
shown
how
absurd
believing
in
clearly
made
up
mythical
beings
is
no
one
actually
believes
in
the
flying
spaghetti
monster
nor
were
they
ever
meant
to
one
could
ask
the
same
of
christians
who
want
the
nativity
scene
to
be
put
on
public
property
goes
both
ways
ya
ll
you
believe
that
ritualized
cannibalism
symbolically
ingesting
blood
and
flesh
of
another
human
cleanses
your
soul
of
sins
that
2
fictitious
people
committed
as
reported
by
illiterate
and
superstitious
goat
herders
also
this
magic
baby
whose
flesh
you
re
eating
was
birthed
by
a
virgin
mother
also
also
a
human
wearing
a
fancy
bathrobe
says
some
magic
words
over
a
bucket
of
water
and
now
said
water
has
all
kinds
of
magical
properties
if
the
shoe
was
on
the
other
foot
and
some
people
smashed
a
nativity
scene
you
d
be
screaming
about
hate
crimes
or
would
you
turn
the
other
cheek
did
someone
forget
to
take
their
ovaltine
you
clearly
do
not
know
enough
about
them
quob
is
as
real
as
any
other
diety
may
you
be
touched
by
his
noodly
appendage
sauce
be
upon
you
holding
the
state
accountable
isn
t
a
waste
of
resources
why
is
that
good
he
at
least
tried
to
equate
them
to
one
it
seems
ignorance
reigns
freedom
of
religion
is
freedom
from
religion
agreed
so
we
are
just
allowing
antisemitism
now
they
re
not
exempt
they
are
a
nonprofit
and
pay
their
taxes
lots
of
tax
exempt
entities
that
are
not
religious
a
religion
of
atheist
they
re
upset
they
started
as
a
cult
they
are
really
into
having
an
invisible
voyeur
sky
daddy
watching
evening
they
do
it
s
such
a
weirdo
fetish
so
it
s
ok
but
only
if
i
worship
satan
earnestly
got
it
i
don
t
think
it
s
trolling
to
attempt
to
keep
all
religions
on
a
fair
playing
field
especially
when
some
religions
love
to
try
to
force
their
beliefs
on
those
who
don
t
agree
with
them
that
s
what
tst
is
about
i
m
not
even
a
member
but
i
m
all
for
it
it
s
federally
recognized
as
a
religion
so
it
s
as
legitimate
as
christianity
as
far
as
i
m
concerned
certainly
has
been
much
less
bloodshed
in
the
name
of
satan
and
the
catholic
church
is
a
shield
for
pedophiles
and
basks
in
idolatry
while
guilt
tripping
people
to
tithe
to
avoid
going
to
hell
just
remove
tax
exempt
status
from
these
fucking
institutions
and
let
s
move
on
with
life
i
m
fully
aware
but
thank
you
for
the
reminder
i
know
thank
you
hopefully
someone
at
mcdonalds
will
snitch
i
doubt
it
was
someone
who
was
so
tolerant
of
other
religions
and
so
happy
it
was
there
they
hugged
it
to
pieces
i
would
be
perfectly
fine
with
no
religious
displays
on
public
property
that
s
almost
always
what
tst
puts
up
a
display
the
goal
is
freedom
from
religion
r
unexpectedletterkenny
the
goal
in
this
for
tst
is
to
have
towns
cities
to
not
have
any
religious
displays
on
public
squares
we
re
accomplishing
the
goal
this
is
the
correct
answer
keep
your
fairy
tales
out
of
my
business
isn
t
that
the
tst
s
ultimate
goal
asserting
separation
of
church
and
state
on
government
property
or
in
their
buildings
also
no
christians
did
this
i
have
less
than
0
000001
belief
it
was
someone
from
the
tst
yup
if
someone
knocked
over
the
tree
they
would
have
the
swat
team
out
looking
for
them
live
free
or
die
my
ass
that
s
most
of
the
point
of
tst
in
the
first
place
to
help
point
out
the
hypocrisy
that
is
religion
maybe
they
ll
get
some
laws
made
for
them
that
hurt
all
religious
organizations
the
people
who
vandalized
are
objectively
evil
intolerant
and
misguided
i
m
sorry
but
which
one
do
you
think
represents
good
and
which
one
evil
the
history
of
organized
religions
trying
to
make
other
organized
religions
unwelcome
in
certain
locations
is
a
history
of
evil
the
history
of
american
religious
pluralism
where
no
one
religion
is
officially
endorsed
and
all
are
welcome
is
a
history
of
good
the
fact
that
these
people
chose
an
icon
that
represents
something
provocative
to
those
who
disagree
with
religious
pluralism
does
not
make
it
an
icon
of
evil
you
have
to
look
at
it
from
the
perspective
of
not
my
faith
not
my
problem
that
s
good
beer
ban
them
all
for
the
win
religion
has
no
place
in
government
link
to
tst
destroying
their
own
property
to
support
it
as
their
schtick
didn
t
think
so
neither
are
they
not
satanist
most
witches
are
not
wiccan
great
news
they
haven
t
banned
the
dictionary
yet
terrorism
the
unlawful
use
of
violence
or
threats
to
intimidate
or
coerce
a
civilian
population
or
government
with
the
goal
of
furthering
political
social
or
ideological
objectives
buddy
you
re
in
for
a
surprise
when
your
middle
school
starts
covering
american
history
ok
so
someone
breaks
the
crech
thing
same
level
of
lack
of
response
i
think
not
yet
they
throw
around
the
word
terror
when
someone
says
trans
and
kid
in
the
same
sentence
even
for
hyperbole
this
is
a
wild
statement
lmao
i
had
to
read
this
three
times
to
ensure
i
was
understanding
it
properly
and
not
because
it
s
an
intellectually
complex
statement

downsized
learning
how
to
deal
with
discomfort
is
also
important
in
other
religions
like
zen
also
a
significant
portion
of
christians
believe
that
suffering
brings
one
closer
to
god
such
as
mother
teresa
i
want
you
to
read
the
tenets
and
then
explain
to
me
why
that
should
make
people
uncomfortable
lmfaoo
just
a
simple
basic
moral
code
can
yall
just
grow
up
and
leave
people
alone
if
it
makes
you
so
mad
that
were
exercising
our
rights
to
freedom
of
religion
then
you
can
leave
our
country
was
founded
on
freedom
of
religion
and
so
we
will
continue
to
try
our
best
to
keep
it
that
way
religion
that
is
ackshually
but
in
a
legally
recognized
form
you
can
follow
moral
principles
and
still
be
an
insufferable
asshole
who
s
asking
for
it
doesn
t
mean
it
s
right
when
someone
gives
it
to
them
but
doesn
t
mean
i
feel
bad
that
they
got
what
they
had
coming
same
way
i
view
that
healthcare
ceo
am
i
sad
nope
should
whomever
did
it
get
away
with
it
nope
i
loudly
profess
how
much
religious
joy
i
find
in
the
suffering
of
other
people
this
is
how
you
can
all
tell
that
i
m
a
good
person
guys
it
s
cool
actually
bc
they
did
paperwork
all
of
my
morality
stems
from
what
the

says
because
i
m
scared
to
admit
i
m
illiterate

do
us
all
a
fuckin
favor
i
cannot
upvote
this
response
enough
well
done
ninja

safe

happy
holidays
to
everyone
well
said
but
that
s
way
over
their
head
it
wasn
t
directed
towards
the
temple
it
was
a
generalization
of
religions
beliefs
vying
against
eachother
if
anything
it
would
be
more
against
the
churches
christians
literally
worship
the
undead
if
you
think
atheists
are
not
hated
you
might
want
to
check
your
facts
people
have
been
murdered
over
it
what
makes
a
religion
fake
their
goal
is
promoting
the
separation
of
church
and
state
the
fact
religions
seem
laughable
from
the
outside
looking
in
is
not
the
fault
of
the
satanic
temple
against
a
fake
religion
whose
purpose
is
to
mock
people
of
faith
especially
christians
you
sound
triggered
i
forget
which
religions
are
fake
why
isn
t
yours
in
your
opinion
who
should
determine
whether
a
religion
is
fake
or
real
fake
religion
according
to
who
any
examples
of
them
mocking
christians
more
than
other
religions
christianity
is
still
far
and
away
the
most
popular
religion
in
this
country
quit
acting
like
a
bunch
of
persecuted
children
just
cause
other
people
don
t
agree
with
your
religion
you
know
all
religions
are
fake
right
like
you
don
t
think
your
sky
man
is
more
real
than
the
other
sky
man
s
do
you
all
religions
are
made
up
just
like
language
they
don
t
want
to
mock
people
of
faith
they
want
to
mock
people
that
play
pretend
that
magic
is
real
which
is
what
the
christian
cultists
do
i
ll
let
you
in
on
a
secret
all
religions
are
fake
and
made
up
room
at
the
inn
well
true
god
isn
t
real
i
don
t
see
any
connection
to
god
no
god
and
drug
use
the
satanist
temple
https
thesatanictemple
com
pages
about
us
doesn
t
worship
satan
baphomet
it
s
just
their
symbol
like
how
christians
don
t
worship
the
fish
or
cross
symbol
they
only
place
public
displays
where
other
religions
do
i
m
pretty
sure
the
bible
has
more
incest
violence
murder
infanticide
rape
and
bestiality
than
any
literature
put
out
by
the
satanic
temple
freedom
of
religion
means
all
religions
if
folks
have
a
problem
with
baphomet
being
included
then
the
traditional
nativity
has
to
be
taken
down
as
well
we
want
our
kids
believing
in
ancient
interdimensional
space
wizards
impregnating
teenagers

t
really
care
about
it
especially
in
this
context
they
are
in
fact
in
the
state
the
article
said
that
they
were
from
salem
ma
and
were
invited
by
democrat
state
rep
ellen
read
and
nobody
cares
it
s
been
a
christian
holiday
for
ages
this
is
just
losers
looking
for
attention
good
yeah
almost
like
it
s
a
political
group
that
tries
to
make
a
point
in
the
news
cycle
truly
not
to
mention
the
various
accusations
of
sexual
misconduct
and
bigotry
lobbed
against
lucian
greaves
that
all
the
progressives
who
worship
him
and
give
him
money
seem
to
overlook
well
everybody
does
have
a
say
especially
in
our
society
where
there
is
separation
of
church
and
state
we
ll
see
how
long
that
wall
stands
with
the
new
regime
and
their
love
affair
with
project
25
the
heritage
foundations
concept
of
sharia
law
evangelical
style
for
america
they
re
different
from
the
norm
it
s
not
bigoted
people
who
call
people
bigots
aren
t
really
normal
normal

nonprofits
don
t
pay
taxes
that
s
why
they
organize
as
nonprofits
tst
claimed
tax
free
status
quite
a
long
time
ago
church
of
satan
is
the
one
that
refuses
to
do
tst
based
a
lot
of
their
religion
off
of
cos
but
they
are
still
different
no
non
profit
does
get
taxed
pending
how
much
they
make
a
year
theism
is
not
a
criterion
for
the
definition
of
religion
that
the
government
uses
there
actually
are
atheistic
religions
more
common
in
asian
religions
some
sects
of
buddhism
are
actually
atheistic
no
atheist
doesn
t
believe
fairy
tale
shit
umm
no
if
separating
church
and
state
are
the
real
goals
here
then
is
leaning
on
a
federal
administrative
policy
to
legitimize
the
satanic
temple
putting
a
statue
of
baphomet
holding
a
lilac
and
an
apple
up
next
to
the
nativity
really
panning
out
here
or
is
the
campaign
of
provocative
trolling
just
affirming
the
consequent
i
dont
not
agree
and
i
m
not
religious
i
m
just
stating
that
your
average
tst
person
is
just
trolling
for
the
sake
of
trolling
rather
than
trying
to
make
some
real
religious
demonstration
i
concur
but
everyone
let
s
islam
off
the
hook
they
re
only
polite
because
they
have
a
minority
irrelevant
to
the
conversation
as
usual
deflect
this
is
the
way
such
a
good
show
i
also
just
had
a
more
sad
thought
that
it
s
also
not
entirely
impossible
that
someone
who
was
on
drugs
mentally
ill
or
both
could
see
this
and
be
terrified
of
it
and
try
and
beat
up
something
that
literally
looks
like
the
most
common
depictions
of
demons
exactly
so
they
don
t
care
about
freedom
of
religion
they
in
fact
want
governments
to
ban
public
expression
of
religion
the
people
who
vandalized
it
eliminated
a
tribute
to
evil
proud
of
them
no
i
don
t
have
to
look
at
it
in
that
perspective
and
not
everyone
sees
baphomet
and
thinks
it
s
about
religious
pluralism
choosing
an
icon
that
specifically
represents
evil
isn
t
the
win
you
think
it
is
and
sure
any
power
structure
that
s
ever
existed
had
abused
that
power
i
m
not
against
checking
religions
but
this
isn
t
the
way
if
religion
has
no
place
in
government
tst
shouldn
t
be
able
to
influence
government
to
ban
religious
displays
that
s
tst
mixing
church
and
state
hypocrites
their
schtick
isn
t
destroying
their
own
property
it
s
trolling
christians
and
pressuring
cities
to
allow
them
to
either
be
obnoxious
or
not
have
holiday
displays
don
t
be
obtuse
you
love
it
but
call
it
what
it
is
i
know
i
m
not
nor
others
the
point
that
needs
to
be
made
is
that
it
doesn
t
matter
the
religion
belief
god
deity
not
in
this
country
can
we
be
passive
or
have
tolerance
on
those
types
of
attacks
or
acts
of
hatred
they
re
opposed
to
anything
spiritual
it
s
just
that
christians
represent
the
largest
spiritual
tradition
in
the
country
so
they
spend
most
of
their
time
going
after
them
seems
like
it
to
me
of
course
it
would
be
the
worst
kind
of
religious
repression
if
a
baby
jesus
were
damaged
tearing
down
a
statue
isn
t
violence
remember
the
summer
of
2020
no
this
ain
t
how
that
works
if
you
want
religious
freedom
then
you
get
that
for
everyone
you
re
beliefs
aren
t
more
important
than
anyone
else
s
i
m
not
satanic
but
i
love
how
they
ve
really
brought
light
to
this
and
this
is
not
the
same
as
the
ceo
this
is
a
horrible
stance
on
free
speech
and
religious
freedom
regardless
of
your
beliefs
both
luigi
and
any
religious
deity
anyone
follows
would
hate
this
freedom
is
the
message
you
re
missing
the
point
praise
be
to
satan
lol
you
re
good
for
each
other
all
good
i
appreciate
it
i
ve
already
been
targeted
by
the
hive
so
there
won
t
be
enough
to
dig
me
out
of
this
one
today
when
catholics
do
their
rituals
they
believe
they
are
literally
eating
his
flesh
and
drinking
his
blood
there
s
some
wild
stuff
out
there
right
in
plain
sight
that
s
just
it
they
re
all
made
up
by
people
none
of
it
s
real
being
made
up
by
somebody
which
means
at
lest
three
or
four
of
them
if
your
religion
is
literally
we
don
t
believe
in
any
god
our
goal
is
just
to
piss
off
the
people
that
do
then
it
s
not
a
religion
these
hogs
know
they
have
the
truest
religion
because
it
was
the
one
closest
to
their
parents
house
that
also
had
convenient
parking
that
is
the
most
enlightened
path
to
eternal
salvation
mine
is
the
one
true
faith
you
heathen
something
about
how
he
hates
christians
christians
suck
tbh
i
m
surprised
it
got
removed
i
hope
my
comment
doesn
t
get
struck
for
mentioning
it
removed
your
comment
was
removed
for
not
following
reddiquette
i
never
said
it
was
not
religious
i
actually
never
brought
up
religion
i
threw
out
my
theory
based
on
my
experience
with
drunks
in
concord
well
i
didn
t
vote
for
him
samuel
adams
signer
of
the
declaration
of
independence
i
conceive
we
cannot
better
express
ourselves
than
by
humbly
supplicating
the
supreme
ruler
of
the
world
that
the
confusions
that
are
and
have
been
among
the
nations
may
be
overruled
by
the
promoting
and
speedily
bringing
in
the
holy
and
happy
period
when
the
kingdoms
of
our
lord
and
savior
jesus
christ
may
be
everywhere
established
and
the
people
willingly
bow
to
the
scepter
of
him
who
is
the
prince
of
peace
rules
for
me
but
no
for
thee
shove
jesus
up
your
ass
here
s
a
lesson
most
people
learn
in
infancy
other
people
are
not
you
just
because
you
don
t
care
doesn
t
mean
other
people
don
t
care
i
would
like
to
see
where
you
get
this
information
from
you
do
know
that
christian
holidays
were
intended
to
counteract
the
pagan
holidays
at
a
time
where
the
church
was
openly
persecuting
and
executing
pagans
right
not
an
answer
who
exactly
is
wasting
police
resources
it
certainly
wouldn
t
be
the
ones
who
put
up
the
statue
man
it
s
fascinating
that
a
turnip
farming
peasant
from
1267
ad
made
it
on
to
reddit
it
was
when
i
was
a
kid
when
did
they
change
it
i
remember
it
being
in
it
in
the
1980
s
1990
s
it
s
mostly
a
pagan
celebration
that
has
been
hijacked
by
the
christian
church
hundreds
of
years
ago
to
coerce
pagans
to
follow
christianity
pagan
holidays
seem
cooler
honestly
i
d
love
the
holiday
to
go
the
hell
away
on
no
day
am
i
as
exhausted
as
i
am
on
christmas
because
of
family
obligations
and
guilt
for
blowing
them
off
to
relax
i
ve
already
gotten
to
the
point
where
i
only
buy
presents
for
my
own
kids
i
don
t
owe
every
family
member
a
damn
gift
fun
fact
technically
christmas
isn
t
a
national
holiday
december
25th
is
the
national
holiday
taoism
is
another
big
one
of
course
they
do
so
they
aren
t
atheists
then
i
guess
i
don
t
know
what
it
is
people
on
here
were
saying
it
was
an
atheist
organization
and
not
really
satanist
putting
up
the
statue
is
firmly
in
line
with
separating
church
in
state
it
shows
evidence
that
the
government
doesn
t
officially
represent
a
singular
religion
it
s
likely
the
easiest
way
to
make
a
point
and
stir
the
shit
pot
they
have
been
doing
this
for
years
and
have
pretty
good
luck
with
their
specific
tactics

legal
action
sorry
just
church
of
satan
satanic
temple
they
are
but
that
s
part
of
the
point
that
they
re
making
who
gets
to
decide
which
religious
beliefs
are
genuine
legally
no
one
should
decide
that
if
you
re
going
to
let
any
religions
have
a
nativity
display
you
have
to
let
the
troll
religions
do
it
too
why
should
religious
beliefs
get
treated
specially
differently
from
other
beliefs
that
s
another
point
they
like
to
make
calling
this
irrelevant
is
an
enormous
deflection
my
dude
this
is
the
way
why
are
you
excusing
mental
illness
you
ok
with
some
nutcase
smashing
a
christian
display
most
schizophrenics
with
religious
delusions
have
christian
based
delusions
so
if
you
want
to
talk
about
what
s
terrifying
to
the
mentally
ill
primarily
it
is
separation
of
church
and
state
but
if
one
religion
is
let
in
the
door
we
better
be
let
in
too
freedom
from
religion
no
we
want
all
religion
out
of
government
not
everyone
believes
in
an
imaginary
invisible
sky
daddy
hail
yourself
they
do
care
about
freedom
of
religion
they
would
have
been
just
fine
with
a
display
of
all
religions
the
opening
ceremony
even
acknowledged
all
the
other
beautiful
displays
at
the
capitol
it
s
only
the
adherents
of
one
religion
that
can
t
stand
not
being
the
center
of
attention
if
you
read
your
post
with
a
tiny
bit
of
critical
thinking
you
have
made
my
point
precisely
thanks
that
s
a
lot
of
words
to
say
i
m
proud
to
be
ignorant
and
refuse
to
recognize
the
hypocrisy
here
you
miss
the
point
completely
if
that
baby
jeebus
wasn
t
there
they
wouldn
t
be
pushing
the
issue
i
think
it
evokes
productive
conversation
i
won
t
express
my
personal
religious
views
but
i
don
t
see
anything
wrong
with
questionning
why
religious
displays
are
permitted
in
front
of
a
state
building
in
the
first
place
separation
of
church
and
state
as
a
concept
should
be
front
of
mind
i
don
t
see
it
as
trolling
christians
per
se
if
anything
if
religious
displays
are
permitted
that
should
be
extended
to
all
religious
organizations
i
don
t
care
if
it
s
christianity
judaism
or
what
i
personally
love
it
why
should
i
be
forced
to
expose
my
children
to
only
certain
religions
in
public
places
especially
those
i
don
t
agree
with
it
s
bs
are
they
wrong
exactly
thank
you
this
is
what
i
ve
been
saying
but
since
i
m
christian
i
get
a
load
of
smooth
brains
completely
missing
the
point
of
tst
and
it
s
symbolism
and
just
think
they
worship
satan
also
their
tenets
are
excellent
opposition
to
spirituality
isn
t
part
of
their
tenets
one
could
conceivably
be
christian
jewish
muslim
buddhist
or
what
have
you
and
a
member
of
tst
concurrently
here
are
their
7
tenets
taken
from
their
site
i
one
should
strive
to
act
with
compassion
and
empathy
toward
all
creatures
in
accordance
with
reason
ii
the
struggle
for
justice
is
an
ongoing
and
necessary
pursuit
that
should
prevail
over
laws
and
institutions
iii
one
s
body
is
inviolable
subject
to
one
s
own
will
alone
iv
the
freedoms
of
others
should
be
respected
including
the
freedom
to
offend
to
willfully
and
unjustly
encroach
upon
the
freedoms
of
another
is
to
forgo
one
s
own
v
beliefs
should
conform
to
one
s
best
scientific
understanding
of
the
world
one
should
take
care
never
to
distort
scientific
facts
to
fit
one
s
beliefs
vi
people
are
fallible
if
one
makes
a
mistake
one
should
do
one
s
best
to
rectify
it
and
resolve
any
harm
that
might
have
been
caused
vii
every
tenet
is
a
guiding
principle
designed
to
inspire
nobility
in
action
and
thought
the
spirit
of
compassion
wisdom
and
justice
should
always
prevail
over
the
written
or
spoken
word
no
it
s
because
christians
are
the
only
ones
trying
to
ram
their
fairytale
down
the
world
s
throat
you
don
t
see
witches
going
around
starting
wars
and
murdering
anyone
that
refuses
to
bow
down
to
their
gods
and
goddesses
imagine
how
up
in
arms
these
people
would
be
if
someone
were
going
around
destroying
all
the
nativity
scene
decorations
i
see
everywhere
i
do
remember
jan
6th
2021
i
support
free
speech
i
however
won
t
get
sad
if
someone
gets
punched
for
singing
the
slaughter
at
the
zoo
i
also
won
t
get
sad
when
whoever
punches
him
gets
arrested
for
assault
you
doxxed
yourself
and
talk
shit
online
to
people
who
could
drive
to
your
house
be
more
careful
b
b
but
jesus
sacrificed
a
whole
weekend
for
us
this
is
the
way
it
s
a
religion
in
the
eyes
of
the
law
which
is
all
that
matters
here
describes
some
versions
of
taoism
and
buddhism
so
are
you
saying
religions
can
only
be
theistic
hahaha
who
s
definition
matters
here
as
with
most
critical
matters
in
the
us
the
irs
is
a
great
place
to
check
first
they
have
given
the
satanic
temple
tax
exempt
status
so
all
good
in
their

the

sorry
their

seem

allow
them
to

the
criteria
of

it

tough
if
you

its

do
not
seem
to
align
with
the
published
tenants
of
the
religion
that
would
certainly
be
a
novel
concept
that
has
never
been
an

with
the
abrahamic

i

mods
go
brrrrrr
i
will
vouch
for
you
dimako
thank
you
i
m
not
surprised
at
all
mods
fucking
suck
on
this
sub
your
comment
was
removed
for
not
following
reddiquette
removed
so
how
much
money
are
you
putting
down
freedom
of
speech
only
matters
when
they
cry
about
it
duh
exactly
right
well
aware
of
history
my
statement
stands
this
is
just
a
tiny
minority
looking
for
attention
honestly
sometimes
i
wish
i
was
a
turnip
farming
peasant
from
1267
1950s
in
response
to
the
red
scare
at
the
height
of
mccarthyism
which
will
be
back
in
force
under
the
second
trump
term
bingo
christianity
is
pagan
with
the
names
changed
odin
is
called
god
thor
is
now
jesus
freya
is
now
mary
the
other
gods
are
now
referred
to
as
saints
christmas
and
easter
are
pagan
holidays
that
s
why
some
hyper
observant
christian
sects
avoid
celebrating
them
i
love
november
and
december
i
get
horridly
depressed
in
january
my
version
of
being
a
weekend
warrior
but
stretched
out
over
a
year
but
yeah
you
gotta
relax
no
guilt
recharge
explain
they
don
t
believe
in
a
literal
being
called
satan
satan
means
adversary
in
this
context
anton
lavey
coined
the
term
for
his
religion
the
church
of
satan
also
atheistic
before
tst
existed
they
took
a
lot
of
his
ideas
added
some
of
their
own
and
tst
was
born
so
yes
they
are
really
satanists
you
just
have
the
wrong
idea
about
what
that
means
nailed
it
the
main
point
is
that
the
government
doesn
t
specifically
endorse
a
single
religion
over
any
other
it
explicitly
affords
equal
rights
to
both
as
opposed
to
a
theocracy
corrected
absolutely
but
i
wish
they
d
pick
on
some
other
religions
and
not
just
the
relatively
safe
one
for
a
change
100
fun
fact
separation
of
church
and
state
never
appears
in
the
constitution
banning
public
displays
of
religions
though
is
very
clearly
a
first
amendment
violation
and
i
ll
watch
as
society
crumbles
as
we
drift
further
from
goodness
and
towards
evil
and
wonder
why
everyone
is
so
selfish
and
has
so
much
trauma
how
about
pretend
to
worship
literally
anything
else
other
than
satan
doing
so
is
purposely
antagonistic
and
only
serves
to
justify
their
sinful
lives
and
you
re
missing
the
point
tst
is
using
it
s
status
as
a
religion
to
try
to
influence
government
to
pass
laws
they
want
it
to
pulling
up
the
ladder
behind
you
is
just
a
dick
move
if
they
truly
believed
in
separation
of
church
and
state
they
wouldn
t
do
this
sort
of
thing
to
make
a
point
exactly
this
as
a
tst
member
you
hit
the
nail
on
the
head
and
is
what
we
want
it
s
trolling
people
who
are
against
freedom
of
from
religion
and
it
s
working
i
don
t
have
a
problem
with
permitting
religious
displays
for
all
religions
that
should
be
legal
as
long
as
it
s
allowed
for
one
however
where
tst
loses
me
on
this
is
that
they
always
make
a
huge
issue
of
it
specifically
at
christmas
then
decide
to
put
their
imagery
up
in
the
most
intrusive
places
possible
with
a
specific
placard
talking
about
their
values
that
s
where
it
crosses
into
trolling
christians
see
also
their
advocacy
page
https
thesatanictemple
com
pages
advocacy
archives
https
thesatanictemple
com
pages
advocacy
archives
it
s
very
obvious
what
they
re
doing
here
not
that
i
mind
what
they
did
to
wbc
that
was
funny
i
doubt
a
jewish
or
muslim
organization
would
put
something
up
on
a
sidewalk
that
impeded
pedestrian
traffic
and
had
a
bunch
of
their
core
tenets
listed
out
they
d
probably
put
up
their
display
on
the
lawn
like
the
nativity
scene
and
leave
it
at
that
you
can
have
a
department
store
baphomet
mannequin
up
on
the
state
lawn
all
you
want
i
don
t
care
but
when
you
put
it
on
the
sidewalk
directly
impeding
foot
traffic
with
a
whole
core
tenets
sign
and
other
stuff
you
re
not
achieving
anything
productive
it
s
just
rage
bait
and
if
you
think
a
nativity
scene
on
the
front
lawn
of
the
state
house
is
forcing
you
to
expose
your
children
to
religion
in
public
places
that
s
more
of
a
you
problem
than
anything
a
road
is
a
public
place
and
private
property
owners
can
put
whatever
scenes
and
decorations
they
want
on
their
lawn
and
you
can
still
be
forced
to
see
it
as
you
drive
by
they
oppose
all
belief
in
the
supernatural
and
any
belief
not
based
on
current
scientific
understanding
and
they
are
purely
materialists
per
their
website
i
mean
it
s
hardly
just
christians
it
s
mostly
christians
here
of
course
but
live
in
india
or
china
or
sudan
and
you
ll
have
a
radically
different
experience
agreed
of
course
that
witches
aren
t
evangelicalistic
or
pushy
i
have
no
problem
with
witches
i
do
have
something
of
a
problem
with
the
temple
because
they
are
pushy
they
exist
primarily
to
use
the
force
of
law
to
impose
their
will
on
local
communities
that
don
t
tend
to
appreciate
their
interference
they
feel
justified
in
doing
so
because
they
re
using
their
opponents
tactics
against
them
and
that
s
a
fair
enough
reason
but
i
d
like
to
see
everyone
have
a
lot
more
tolerance
for
each
other
including
public
expressions
of
faith
that
i
don
t
share
in
myself
absent
the
threat
of
force
religious
expression
provides
cultural
enrichment
and
depth
of
meaning
that
should
be
respected
and
tolerated
even
when
it
isn
t
shared
enforced
secularization
of
public
spaces
is
unfortunately
necessary
if
people
can
t
behave
but
it
s
a
sad
loss
to
authentic
human
culture
as
a
christian
myself
i
know
what
it
s
like
to
be
a
repressed
minority
s
hang
the
baby
jesus
from
the
statehouse
good
that
was
violent
that
s
a
weak
stance
i
disagree
seems
like
a
threat
as
tempestuous
as
the
mods
on
this
sub
can
be
the
op
was
removed
by
a
site
wide
admin
removed
by
reddit
is
an
admin
thing
i
think
it
wasn
t
a
subreddit
mod
here
who
deleted
it
though
they
certainly
could
have
reported
him
your
comment
was
removed
for
not
following
reddiquette
removed
yea
next
to
the
display
representing
ages
of
genocidal
persecution
and
child
molestation
got
it
yeah
you
re
probably
more
suited
for
that
type
of
life
that
is
what
fundamentalist
evangelicals
say
about
catholics
as
a
way
to
say
catholics
aren
t
really
christian
in
bam
all
the
catholic
books
are
not
in
the
christian
section
but
siloed
elsewhere
hints
of
the
know
nothings
of
the
past
do
they
just
hide
inside
their
prepper
bunkers
all
week
https
en
wikipedia
org
wiki
names
of
the
days
of
the
week
right
and
they
should
probably
codify
that
with
some
sort
of
rule
about
making
no
law
with
respect
to
such
limiting
such
and
maybe
even
protect
free
speech
and
yet
now
there
will
be
an
effort
at
the
state
level
to
do
exactly
that
because
of
a
dare
i
say
it
satyr
ical
statue
placed
as
a
provocation
the
assumption
here
seems
to
be
fight
the
legal
battle
and
then
all
is
removed
on
the
other
hand
we
could
just
as
easily
end
up
enshrining
specific
religions
as
having
priority
something
anyone
with
enough
grasp
of
history
to
recognize
that
statue
should
also
have
been
wary
of
the
relatively
safe
one
that
has
used
their
political
power
to
delay
or
eliminate
the
end
of
slavery
acceptance
of
people
of
color
interracial
marriage
gay
marriage
trans
healthcare
women
s
bodily
autonomy
and
systemically
covered
up
the
abuse
of
children
that
relatively
safe
one
they
are
fantasists
that
use
their
religion
as
a
cudgel
to
deny
other
people
their
rights
and
cause
pain
suffering
and
death
because
of
their
closed
minded
cruelty
i
don
t
want
to
have
to
look
at
their
stupid
symbols
all
over
property
i
pay
taxes
to
maintain
and
i
don
t
want
them
indoctrinating
children
in
schools
the
relatively
safe
one
is
the
one
that
has
political
power
though
the
one
that
s
behind
a
lot
of
anti
education
anti
woman
anti
lgbt
legislation
the
others
don
t
really
have
notable
political
power
in
the
us
the
government
endorsing
one
religion
over
the
hundreds
of
others
is
the
problem
doesn
t
matter
if
it
s
not
in
the
original
document
it
was
added
to
the
bill
of
rights
religion
has
no
place
in
the
government
i
love
how
people
don
t
get
that
it
doesn
t
have
to
actually
be
a
literal
statement
the
first
amendment
of
the
united
states
constitution
is
the
primary
federal
government
document
that
addresses
the
separation
of
church
and
state
establishment
clause
the
first
clause
of
the
first
amendment
states
that
congress
cannot
create
a
law
that
establishes
a
religion
this
prevents
the
government
from
favoring
one
religion
over
another
or
from
creating
an
official
religion
free
exercise
clause
the
first
amendment
also
protects
the
right
of
citizens
to
practice
their
religion
as
they
choose
other
documents
that
relate
to
the
separation
of
church
and
state
include
treaties
the
treaty
of
paris
and
the
treaty
of
tripoli
court
decisions
church
of
the
holy
trinity
v
united
states
danbury
baptist
letter
thomas
jefferson
originally
wrote
a
wall
of
eternal
separation
between
church
and
state
in
this
letter
but
later
deleted
the
word
eternal
the
phrase
separation
of
church
and
state
is
often
used
in
court
cases
for
example
in
everson
v
board
of
education
supreme
court
justice
hugo
black
stated
that
the
first
amendment
erected
a
wall
between
church
and
state
no
one
s
banning
public
displays
of
religion
put
up
100
baphomets
or
crucifixes
or
whatever
you
want
on
your
property
wear
a
shirt
that
says
i
fucks
with
jesus
that
s
up
to
you
but
if
people
can
t
behave
like
adults
over
what
s
put
up
on
public
property
then
banning
them
entirely
is
an
completely
reasonable
choice
first
amendment
does
not
give
you
any
rights
to
put
shit
up
on
property
you
don
t
own
the
establishment
clause
makes
it
pretty
apparent
though
that
tst
has
a
right
to
have
its
display
that
was
just
trashed
they
aren
t
banning
public
displays
of
religion
and
no
political
movement
that
i
m
aware
of
has
plans
to
including
a
lot
of
fringe
left
wing
and
right
wing
movements
whoever
told
you
that
is
lying
and
they
know
it
what
is
forbidden
by
the
first
amendment
is
government
sponsored
or
made
religious
displays
it
s
literally
the
first
part
congress
shall
make
no
law
respecting
an
establishment
of
religion
or
prohibiting
the
free
exercise
thereof
or
abridging
the
freedom
of
speech
or
of
the
press
or
the
right
of
the
people
peaceably
to
assemble
and
to
petition
the
government
for
a
redress
of
grievances
do
you
genuinely
think
building
or
buying
statues
of
christian
or
muslim
or
any
other
religion
figures
and
symbols
is
not
included
in
respecting
an
establishment
of
religion
fun
fact
the
idea
is
it
s
the
phrase
commonly
used
to
describe
the
idea
nobody
needs
to
quote
the
1a
every
time
the
concept
comes
up
in
informal
settings
permitting
one
religion
over
another
is
the
government
favoring
one
means
that
laws
were
passed
respecting
religion
which
is
unconstitutional
it
means
that
if
one
is
allowed
then
all
must
be
treated
equally
no
matter
what
if
a
governing
body
removes
one
religious
icon
like
that
then
they
must
remove
all
no
i
do
not
have
to
look
at
it
from
that
perspective
it
is
intentionally
antagonistic
to
show
off
the
hypocrisy
of
christians
and
how
the
legal
system
favors
and
promotes
christianity
over
other
religions
i
wager
their
lives
are
less
sinful
than
yours
or
others
who
advocate
for
violence
destruction
or
vandalism
against
that
which
they
disagree
with
you
ve
already
showcased
your
biases
and
willingness
to
flout
decency
kindness
and
lawfulness
to
attack
what
you
perceive
as
evil
none
of
your
responses
are
the
win
you
think
they
are
nor
are
you
as
righteous
or
as
thought
provoking
as
you
appear
to
believe
have
a
blessed
day
i
disagree
media
outlets
give
them
extra
attention
during
christmas
but
they
are
active
all
year
long
all
over
the
us
i
think
it
falls
into
publicizing
their
religion
at
a
time
when
people
are
paying
attention
the
philosophy
of
every
commercial
in
front
of
the
arch
is
handled
by
the
city
and
behind
it
is
state
property
the
state
has
different
rules
and
standards
the
city
has
always
allowed
a
nativity
scene
and
a
bill
of
rights
display
the
fact
that
the
area
isn
t
more
heavily
utilized
by
the
jewish
or
muslim
communities
speaks
volumes
to
the
culture
at
the
city
independent
of
any
debates
about
tst
it
s
not
about
whether
they
would
it
s
about
whether
they
could
in
their
defense
why
would
they
do
it
at
any
other
time
christians
aren
t
typically
asking
for
permits
to
put
up
crosses
or
nativity
scenes
on
the
state
house
lawn
at
any
other
time
either
why
is
it
any
different
it
wasn
t
impeding
foot
traffic
it
was
on
a
large
plaza
next
to
the
back
edge
people
had
easily
another
15
ft
clear
to
get
around
it
my
taxes
don
t
pay
for
their
property
so
that
comparison
makes
no
sense
also
have
ever
even
been
to
the
statehouse
do
you
have
any
idea
how
wide
that
sidewalk
is
sounds
like
you
re
talking
out
of
your
ass
ok
then
quote
or
screenshot
the
part
of
the
site
that
says
that
so
we
believe
you
so
religious
symbol
at
the
state
house
lol
unbelievers
telling
people
about
the
rights
of
believers
lol
fxrky
some
want
it
both
ways
please
buddy
lmfao
comment
and
block
lol
so
typical
without
an
argument
per
oxford
dictionary
the
occult
is
belief
in
the
mystical
supernatural
and
magical
beliefs
it
s
not
an
actual
religion
you
should
look
into
it
and
understand
what
it
really
is
before
admiring
it
lol
weak
to
which
part
or
both
that
neither
the
punching
nor
the
arresting
should
happen
cause
we
should
all
leave
each
other
alone
is
the
way
things
should
work
it
just
isnt
how
the
work
in
practice
advice
your
comment
was
removed
for
not
following
reddiquette
removed
i
mean
i
m
a
quadriplegic
so
i
couldn
t
pick
a
turnip
even
if
i
tried
yet
and
even
that
s
regional
this
sort
of
feigned
outrage
is
absurd
christmas
is
a
historically
cultural
tradition
many
non
believers
still
celebrate
the
government
isn
t
forcing
anyone
to
be
christian
if
you
can
prove
to
me
that
the
government
denied
any
other
permits
for
religious
displays
you
have
a
point
otherwise
you
don
t
it
s
not
in
the
bill
of
rights
either
the
language
is
clear
congress
shall
make
no
law
respecting
an
establishment
of
religion
or
prohibiting
the
free
exercise
thereof
or
abridging
the
freedom
of

or
of
the
press
or
the
right
of
the
people
peaceably
to
assemble
and
to
petition
the
government
for
a
redress
of
grievances
it
says
nothing
about
a
separation
of
church
and
state
it
means
the
federal
government
cannot
establish
a
federal
sanction
religion
the
supreme
court
has
ruled
states
can
t
do
that
either
prohibiting
private
displays
in
public
places
would
be
an
infringement
on
free
speech
according
to
lemon
they
can
t
promote
religion
at
a
state
level
land
owned
by
the
state
being
used
for
only
one
religion
is
definitely
promoting
one
over
the
others
using
your
religion
to
force
the
government
to
take
action
against
other
religions
isn
t
separation
of
church
and
state
at
all
which
gets
headlines
and
donations
the
city
isn
t
building
nor
buying
statues
of
religious
figures
they
re
allowing
them
to
be
put
up
on
public
property
which
is
explicitly
permitted
per
the
first
amendment
and
that
is
what
tst
is
trying
to
pressure
them
to
change
by
doing
what
they
re
doing
show
me
when
they
applied
for
a
permit
for
a
display
when
there
was
nothing
else
going
on
every
example
they
give
on
their
own
website
is
reactionary
in
nature
does
tst
not
have
a
holy
holiday
it
wants
to
celebrate
they
could
also
just
do
it
for
publicity
if
they
wanted
to
would
you
be
saying
the
same
thing
if
someone
put
up
a
big
crucifix
in
the
same
spot
i
doubt
it
you
re
going
to
need
to
explain
to
me
how
the
exposure
of
seeing
a
nativity
scene
varies
depending
on
what
plot
of
land
it
s
on
no
nor
do
we
believe
in
the
existence
of
satan
or
the
supernatural
the
satanic
temple
believes
that
religion
can
and
should
be
divorced
from
superstition
as
such
we
do
not
promote
a
belief
in
a
personal
satan
to
embrace
the
name
satan
is
to
embrace
rational
inquiry
removed
from
supernaturalism
and
archaic
tradition
based
superstitions
satanists
should
actively
work
to
hone
critical
thinking
and
exercise
reasonable
agnosticism
in
all
things
our
beliefs
must
be
malleable
to
the
best
current
scientific
understandings
of
the
material
world
never
the
reverse
the
idea
that
religion
belongs
to
supernaturalists
is
ignorant
backward
and
offensive
the
metaphorical
satanic
construct
is
no
more
arbitrary
to
us
than
are
the
deeply
held
beliefs
that
we
actively
advocate
are
we
supposed
to
believe
that
those
who
pledge
submission
to
an
ethereal
supernatural
deity
hold
to
their
values
more
deeply
than
we
are
we
supposed
to
concede
that
only
the
superstitious
are
rightful
recipients
of
religious
exemption
and
privilege
satanism
provides
all
that
a
religion
should
be
without
a
compulsory
attachment
to
untenable
items
of
faith
based
belief
it
provides
a
narrative
structure
by
which
we
contextualize
our
lives
and
works
it
also
provides
a
body
of
symbolism
and
religious
practice
a
sense
of
identity
culture
community
and
shared
values
you
guys
are
slandering
them
as
far
as
they
re
concerned
unless
you
re
talking
about
materialist
witches
who
only
believe
in
the
power
of
a
ritual
action
to
influence
your
own
psyche
of
which
i
have
met
one
or
two
unbelievers
buddy
please
lmfao
unbelievers
have
the
same
rights
as
believers
so
do
people
who
believe
differently
there
are
some
important
concepts
here
you
should
look
into
them
the
test
of
religion
under
the
1a
is
sincerity
and
not
sufficiency
the
state
doesn
t
consider
whether
something
is
or
isn
t
a
religion
but
whether
the
person
sincerely
believes
the
positions
they
espouse
besides
alternative
pagan
religions
totally
exist
this
statue
was
peacefully
placed
there
if
christians
want
their
beliefs
to
be
respected
then
they
need
to
respect
all
beliefs
regardless
of
how
much
they
relate
to
them
the
person
who
shot
the
ceo
was
an
entirely
different
message
you
can
t
intertwine
the
two
i
am
not
satanic
but
i
fully
support
the
message
the
satanic
temple
gives
free
speech
and
the
freedom
to
believe
in
what
we
choose
everyone
should
be
behind
that
for
someone
who
s
agnostic
there
s
no
difference
between
this
or
jesus
i
am
not
agnostic
and
see
a
huge
difference
but
i
also
respect
that
this
is
my
personal
opinion
i
believe
in
free
speech
and
freedom
over
anything
else
as
someone
who
s
very
spiritual
i
will
say
that
i
believe
jesus
would
have
fought
for
people
to
have
a
statue
like
this
he
wasn
t
trying
to
control
people
he
was
fighting
for
personal
sovereignty
that
s
what
this
represents
yes
because
your
initial
comment
was
so
welcoming
and
friendly
god
bless
merry
christmas
removed
your
comment
was
removed
for
not
following
reddiquette
jewish
and
muslim
groups
have
some
local
power
but
it
pales
compared
to
christian
sects
tst
does
these
stunts
in
response
to
government
actions
if
government
was
acting
on
behalf
of
other
religions
regularly
they
d
be
poking
at
those
religions
too
why
are
you
against
freedom
of
religion
if
you
are
using
public
land
you
need
to
let
everyone
use
the
land
not
just
one
group
the
fastest
growing
religious
ideology
is
to
not
be
religious
tell
that
to
oklahoma
louisiana
and
any
other
state
requiring
the
ten
commandments
to
be
posted
in
schools
or
the
bible
to
be
taught
i
don
t
think
people
are
outraged
by
the
celebration
of
christmas
at
all
most
americans
celebrate
christmas
the
issue
is
whether
or
not
the
government
should
be
involved
in
celebrating
christmas
since
the
government
can
t
establish
or
endorse
a
religion
it
would
either
have
to
approve
permits
to
other
religions
that
seek
use
of
government
property
in
a
similar
manner
or
approve
none
of
them
i
think
a
lot
of
folks
would
agree
that
government
should
stay
out
of
a
lot
of
personal
things
no
nobody
s
gotta
prove
anything
to
you
my
guy
you
re
just
some
random
anonymous
crank
you
are
missing
that
the
14th
amendment
applies
the
restrictions
placed
on
the
government
to
the
states
as
well
there
s
nuance
of
course
but
the
implication
you
make
that
the
1st
amendment
only
applies
to
congress
being
restricted
is
incorrect
if
the
government
allows
religious
speech
at
all
it
must
not
show
favor
to
one
religion
it
also
cannot
make
a
judgment
as
to
what
is
a
legitimate
religion
vs
what
is
not
beyond
a
few
reasonable
questions
because
courts
have
determined
that
would
violate
the
establishment
clause
what
i
m
saying
is
this
the
framers
included
protection
for
and
from
religion
in
the
constitution
for
a
reason
everyone
should
have
the
right
to
practice
their
religion
freely
until
it
infringes
on
another
s
rights
what
happens
if
the
government
one
day
decides
to
promote
another
religion
other
than
christianity
the
choice
is
clear
either
you
have
to
give
a
permit
to
all
religions
which
the
government
can
t
really
define
or
give
a
permit
to
none
yes
that
s
the
point
religious
organizations
should
not
have
the
ability
to
exert
that
kind
of
influence
however
they
do
one
of
them
is
attempting
to
use
that
influence
to
remove
said
influence
what
s
your
specific
objection
to
that
it
can
t
be
that
religious
organizations
shouldn
t
be
able
to
do
so
because
agreement
is
the
opposite
of
objection
what
s
the
difference
between
your
religion
and
one
you
put
in
quotes
honest
question
no
it
s
pointing
out
when
government
gives
special
treatment
to
religious
groups
by
demanding
equal
treatment
even
though
bigots
like
you
don
t
feel
like
their
belief
system
qualifies
as
a
religion
this
is
what
christianity
has
been
doing
for
decades
so
i
m
glad
you
re
coming
around
to
understanding
the
issue
who
did
that
good
what
is
the
zillion
dollar
christian
grift
afraid
of
a
little
competition
the
tst
is
literally
trying
to
put
up
a
religious
display
it
s
permitted
as
long
as
they
permit
any
religious
group
to
also
put
up
its
displays
tst
is
just
asking
the
government
to
be
true
to
its
constitutional
obligations
absolutely
they
are
all
reactionary
to
defend
the
4th
fundamental
tenet
of
tst
my
point
was
that
only
a
minority
of
them
are
related
to
christmas
they
take
action
all
year
long
you
re
completely
missing
the
point
and
whether
it
s
a
holiday
or
not
is
irrelevant
it
s
explicitly
a
commentary
on
the
separation
between
church
and
state
to
my
precious
point
if
the
church
was
getting
permits
to
put
the
nativity
scene
up
in
july
then
yeah
tst
would
probably
do
this
in
july
too
what
s
your
point
you
mean
like
the
giant
10x15
foot
nativity
scene
a
mere
40
feet
away
on
the
other
end
of
the
sidewalk
you
have
no
clue
what
you
re
talking
about
if
you
think
this
thing
in
any
way
was
in
the
way
i
wouldn
t
care
at
all
i
think
anyone
should
be
able
to
put
up
a
display
let
me
dumb
this
down
for
you
i
m
a
landowner
i
pay
a
decent
amount
of
property
tax
to
the
state
of
nh
part
of
my
taxes
go
to
the
upkeep
of
public
grounds
like
the
statehouse
therefore
when
the
statehouse
is
allowed
to
exhibit
some
religious
scenes
for
a
religion
i
don
t
agree
with
they
re
explicitly
using
my
resources
to
expose
my
children
to
dogma
against
my
wishes
however
my
taxes
do
not
pay
for
other
people
s
property
or
the
objects
they
place
on
their
property
they
re
free
to
do
whatever
the
fuck
they
want
just
as
i
m
free
to
think
they
re
brainwashed
idiots
one
is
private
land
one
is
public
are
you
that
stupid
or
just
being
obtuse
i
have
to
assume
it
s
the
latter
your
comment
was
removed
for
not
following
reddiquette
removed
the
satan
trolls
were
free
to
put
up
their
hideous
figure
and
then
rip
it
down
and
pretend
to
be
victims
i
m
not
against
it
from
a
legal
perspective
but
trolling
isn
t
a
religion
either
tell
them
you
re
not
a
victim
no
i
think
that
type
of
absolutism
is
absurd
like
manchester
and
similar
cities
should
do
away
with
seasonal
christmas
decorations
lighting
parades
etc
or
also
hold
a
parade
for
the
massive
dildo
worshipers
there
s
no
cultural
historic
precedence
for
the
massive
dildo
worshipers
or
other
trolls
why
not
allegedly
the
government
is
endorsing
one
religion
over
hundreds
of
others
i
d
like
to
see
proof
of
that
so
it
s
ok
for
tst
to
use
it
s
status
as
a
religion
to
force
the
state
to
do
what
it
wants
but
it
s
not
ok
for
other
religions
why
not
what
s
the
difference
because
one
was
established
long
before
what
we
know
and
understand
government
to
be
and
long
before
our
government
decided
to
respect
freedom
of
religion
the
other
was
formed
specifically
to
exploit
that
freedom
of
religion
for
political
gain
tst
and
it
s
supporters
have
openly
stated
that
they
want
the
government
to
not
allow
religion
to
be
expressed
freely
except
in
this
case
the
government
very
specifically
didn
t
give
special
treatment
to
anyone
tst
got
their
display
so
the
argument
is
bullshit
all
tst
is
doing
is
exactly
what
they
bitch
about
other
religions
doing
using
their
status
as
a
religion
to
try
and
influence
government
they
re
just
as
hypocritical
as
those
they
criticize
decades
christians
have
been
slaughtering
those
of
other
beliefs
to
convert
them
almost
since
its
inception
your
comment
was
removed
for
not
following
reddiquette
removed
where
s
your
evidence
they
ripped
their
own
statue
down
so
go
look
for
some
don
t
be
so
lazy
it
took
at
least
5
years
for
my
city
to
approve
a
menorah
display
no
it
isn
t
that
s
the
point
how
are
you
not
understanding
this
there
is
none
if
you
allow
religion
you
allow
all
religion
one
religion
just
had
their
religious
display
smashed
in
the
free
country
of
the
usa
and
other
religions
were
established
long
before
christianity
that
has
no
bearing
on
anything
there
should
be
no
religious
displays
on
any
government
property
or
if
there
is
then
all
have
the
right
to
be
displayed
keep
the
religious
displays
on
church
property
tst
is
purely
about
freedom
you
should
be
free
to
personally
pursue
whatever
religion
you
choose
best
aligns
with
your
beliefs
or
lack
thereof
it
is
the
government
who
is
not
allowed
to
pursue
any
specific
religion
thus
when
it
the
government
shows
bias
by
allowing
the
display
of
a
purely
christian
nature
it
is
in
breach
of
our
constitutional
rights
the
ways
to
correct
this
are
to
remove
any
religious
iconography
from
government
lands
or
approve
all
requested
displays
from
any
recognized
religion
you
do
know
that
the
roman
empire
was
in
full
swing
during
the
time
of
christ
yeah
and
when
exactly
do
you
think
ancient
religions
existed
and
do
you
think
governments
like
say
the
greeks
who
we
loosely
base
our
own
republic
on
came
before
or
after
that
political
gain
dude
right
in
this
case
the
government
didn
t
give
a
religious
group
special
treatment
which
is
how
it
s
supposed
to
work
their
argument
isn
t
bullshit
just
cuz
they
won
but
saying
that
they
shouldn
t
have
won
they
should
be
discriminated
against
and
their
permit
should
have
been
denied
is
saying
that
you
want
government
to
give
some
religious
groups
special
treatment
over
others
in
one
city
in
one
state
it
was
approved
you
can
look
up
how
many
court
cases
have
happened
due
to
the
historic
denial
my
friend
this
is
the
point
it
s
an
inherently
absurdist
argument
to
approve
all
religious
demonstrations
so
the
government
should
approve
none
why
do
you
need
the
government
to
celebrate
christmas

if
i
remember
correctly
i
think
the
digestive
track
of
a
deer
has
a
hard
time
switching
from
eating
grain
then
moving
on
and
eating
natural
foods
from
the
environment
bark
vegetation
etc
easy
i
ve
never
fed

regardless
of
how
brutal
that

were

from
f
g
the
deer
will
be
ok

they
are
feasting

good

i

no

it
ain

my

i
am
fascinated

many
aspects
of
wildlife
outside

class
if
i
experience
a
wild
animal
i
often
stop

safely
take

i
e
keep
my

humans
injecting
themselves
into
the
equation
for
the

of
extending
wildlife
is
ignorance

selfishness
at

how

i
suspect
that
the
picture
is
from
this
event
this
was
the
case
in
2015
when
twelve
deer
were
found
dead
around
a
feed
site
in
south
hampton
after
being
given
food
they
could
not
digest
wait

aren
t
cloud

durham
tomorrow
thanks
whatever
happened
to
cloudboy
happy
to
get
the
update
on
this
though
much
appreciated
it
was
about
this
time
last
year
we
had
a
pretty
big
flood
looks
like
it
s
happening
again
last
year
it
almost
got
me
probably
within
20
feet
of
my
house
closest
since
hurricane
irene
in
2011
well
fuck
we
have
been
in
a
major
drought
the
rain
is
needed
oh
good
ice
followed
up
by
50
mph
wind
broadsiding
my
house
with
ice
covered
dropped
branches
for
the
rest
of
the
day
and
the
only
route
off
this
stupid
fucking
hill
is
expected
to
flood
fantastic
it
s
going
to
be
in
the
60s
tomorrow
thanks
for
the
write
up

is
there
any
way
to
predict
or
estimate
the
outcome
of
rising
levels
of
bodies
of
water
in
particular
i
m
wondering
about
the
ellis
river
thank
you
so
much
for
sharing
this
glad
i
left
for
texas
yesterday
it
was
75
degrees
and
sunny
when
i
arrived
no
real
concerns
about
the
storm
just
more
rain
no
big
deal
had
to
fill
in
since
my
buddies
in
vermont
keep
getting
devastated
by
flooding
year
after
year
thought
a
public
service
announcement
was
in
line
for
this
storm
if
this
was
falling
as
snow
i
suspect
half
the
state
would
be
in
a
blizzard
warning
this
is
a
storm
you
want
to
fall
as
rain
and
not
snow
it
s
not
even
winter
yet
but
don
t
worry
it
is
coming
don
t
worry
it
s
the
coldest
winter
for
the
foreseeable
future
lots
more
december
rain
in
store
for
us
in
the
next
decades
at
least
durham
is
relatively
safe
from
flooding
no
big
rivers
no
lakes
just
stay
away
from
108
i
would
agree
with
that
statement
they
are
still
around
he
posted
on
an
earlier
thread
today
this
won
t
really
help
it
is
too
much
rain
too
quickly
and
will
largely
run
off
and
not
soak
into
the
ground
to
the
aquifers
where
it
is
needed
in
some
places
the
ground
is
already
frozen
so
it
won
t
soak
in
at
all
making
the
possibility
of
flooding
in
those
areas
worse
hopefully
by
the
time
the
winds
really
kick
up
the
temps
will
be
well
into
the
mid
40s
to
low
50s
that
should
allow
the
ice
to
melt
off
instead
of
weighing
the
trees
down
it
s
nice
to
step
back
and
see
what
other
folks
will
post
here
during
certain
storms
this
storm
is
probably
going
to
hit
nh
the
hardest
with
the
combo
of
rain
and
snowmelt
it
would
be
even
worse
in
the
walloomsac
river
and
otter
creek
basins
if
there
was
more
snow
water
equivalent
up
in
the
mountains
there
op
my
only
suggestion
is
to
lean
more
on
the
higher
resolution
guidance
at
this
range
especially
because
a
number
of
the
features
are
mesoscale
on
the
order
of
several
kilometers
wide
spatially
in
nature
and
a
core
of
the
precip
will
form
from
smaller
scale
upslope
terrain
interactions
your
profile
pic
tho
thank
you
for
the
suggestion
i
will
take
a
look
at
the
high
resolution
models
and
learn
them
better
and
try
to
incorporate
them
for
future
interpretation
public
service
statements
oh
i
ve
got
15
inches
of
snow
on
the
ground
in
the
whites
i
was
there
it
s
the
same
as
it
is
now
but
the
malls
were
crowded
and
people
were
still
more
pleasant
wow
strange
to
think
there
were
only
like
4
places
back
then
and
i
don
t
remember
any
of
them
im
sorry
but
new
hampshire
isn
t
the
sum
of
four
family
fun
spots
not
one
picture
of
the
old
man
on
the
mountain
so
our
state
was
a
gimmicky
tourist
trap
back
then
well
i
ve
seen
the
change
from
the
50s
especially
in
the
southern
tier
of
the
state
there
were
once
still
farms
true
agriculture
and
suburban
sprawl
n
the
bullshit
we
have
today
didn
t
exist
yet
near
manchester
was
all
farmland
on
the
outside
of
the
city
from
south
willow
street
all
the
way
to
bedford
all
the
way
to
the
river
back
river
road
which
is
now
just
another
strip
mall
piece
of
crap
was
filled
with
historic
homes
and
the
old
white
horse
tavern
it
was
one
of
the
first
buildings
to
be
demolished
when
jordan
s
decided
to
build
but
then
rejected
the
site
the
building
was
demolished
for
nothing
the
great
maple
is
still
there
if
you
know
what
you
re
looking
for
near
the
highway
and
all
the
other
garbage
of
today
roads
in
general
were
narrower
the
craziness
of
the
federal
dollars
of
the
seventies
widening
everything
extra
large
breakdown
lanes
and
extra
lanes
in
every
little
town
and
village
destroyed
the
bucolic
beauty
that
once
was
in
every
place
there
is
not
a
village
that
was
not
ruined
with
the
process
you
can
see
the
difference
that
you
cross
into
vermont
to
massachusetts
the
different
standards
that
were
adopted
londonderry
was
still
sleepy
but
continued
to
build
so
the
60s
and
the
70s
into
the
80s
and
of
course
derry
num
13
i
don
t
think
is
in
meredith
it
s
in
gilford
phew
was
worried
someone
took
a
picture
of
me
passed
out
in
the
toilet
of
the
elvis
room
in
1997
immediately
recognized
six
gun
city
as
the
main
thumbnail
my
first
job
pretty
normal
starting
point
for
a
lot
of
high
schoolers
in
that
area
but
in
hindsight
a
very
unique
experience
too
much
north
show
me
some
old
school
manchester
nashua
salem
derry
not
one
picture
of
the
natural
beauty
of
the
state
man
those
cabins
look
cozy
i
think
we
should
keep
it
to
the
travel
agents
we
will
end
up
with
less
stanley
cups
and
straws
in
our
streams
and
rivers
and
maybe
a
few
less
people
manifesting
abundance
and
gratitude
in
the
same
place
you
guys
desperately
need
to
hire
an
editor
lol
back
when
things
were
cheap
simple
and
fun
massachusetts
transplants
ruined
all
of
it
biggest
difference
is
there
s
no
giant
water
slide
park
at
weirs
beach
any
more
this
is
factually
correct
plus
firework
stores
and
storage
units
of
the
mountain
no
just
the
photos
are
all
of
the
same
few
gimmicky
tourist
traps
that
existed
back
then
imagine
calling
clark
s
a
gimmicky
tourist
trap
that
place
is
a
state
treasure
i
don
t
understand
why
everyone
loves
narrow
roads
honestly
if
you
haven
t
seen
any
narrow
roads
in
the
state
you
need
to
get
out
of
derry
imo
was
thinking
the
same
scrolled
through
every
photo
looking
for
any
of
those
towns
and
was
very
disappointed
southern
nh
is
so
underrepresented
whenever
nh
is
mentioned
despite
that
being
where
the
majority
of
people
in
the
state
live
my
whole
childhood
i
wanted
to
stay
in
one
finally
did
in
the
mid
90s
got
one
in
woodstock
during
the
highland
games
with
my
girlfriend
at
the
time
i
think
it
was
the
first
time
we
took
an
overnight
trip
somewhere
as
a
couple
poured
that
weekend
it
was
a
nice
room
to
get
warm
and
dry
in
and
for
some
reason
funspot
mini
golf
is
inside
now
off
the
mountain
back
in
the
day
you
had
to
talk
to
travel
agents
and
ask
if
they
knew
any
unique
places
then
you
could
get
lost
if
you
took
a
wrong
turn
off
i
93
when
your
friend
misread
a
map
clearly
someone
s
family
summer
vacation
photos
and
they
went
to
the
same
places
every
time
when
i
retire
i
want
to
try
out
to
be
the
wolfman
might
need
to
do
some
sit
ups
because
they
re
beautiful
ribbons
of
asphalt
that
take
you
through
the
countryside
to
where
you
want
to
be
you
should
go
travel
through
europe
although
vermont
has
a
fair
amount
of
them
as
well
the
new
hampshire
has
been
so
automobile
centric
that
the
beauty
has
been
asphalted
out
of
it
it
s
quite
sad
but
especially
in
the
village
centers
where
everything
has
been
widened
to
some
1970
standard
i
don
t
have
a
problem
with
interstates
of
course
or
a
secondary
important
road
widened
accordingly
but
in
new
hampshire
s
ridiculous
i
looked
at
a
house
in
durham
on
the
oyster
river
a
couple
of
years
ago
a
beautiful
location
facing
the
mill
pond
but
you
faced
the
main
road
into
downtown
durham
the
college
campus
this
ridiculous
road
which
should
have
just
been
a
simple
two
lane
road
lined
with
elm
trees
was
as
if
you
could
move
the
battle
battalion
s
of
red
square
in
formation
into
the
college
town
what
the
fuck
the
sea
of
asphalt
in
front
of
his
house
four
lanes
wide
two
travel
lanes
two
huge
huge
breakdown
lanes
and
then
you
get
into
the
town
itself
and
it
s
an
automobile
engineering
nightmare
somebody
went
to
work
on
there
engineering
desk
about
how
many
cars
per
minute
for
so
many
square
feet
or
of
however
these
rules
are
compiled
and
came
up
with
this
nightmare
of
asphalt
wide
lanes
in
small
side
rocks
in
this
little
college
town
which
is
normally
swamped
with
pedestrians
but
of
course
that
s
just
the
poster
child
that
came
to
mind
but
the
same
thing
happens
in
just
about
any
time
you
go
to
that
accepted
federal
funds
to
vandalize
the
place
go
drive
around
vermont
on
back
roads
or
better
yet
go
to
central
europe
where
the
village
abruptly
ends
and
the
fields
begin
it
doesn
t
matter
what
kind
of
traffic
is
on
it
the
house
s
don
t
yield
and
the
road
snakes
through
the
village
after
all
i
was
there
first
in
america
that
s
not
the
way
it
works
the
far
flung
suburbs
the
strip
malls
the
sprawl
are
all
service
by
everybody
coming
and
going
and
everybody
along
the
way
is
just
fucked
like
114
going
to
goffstown
just
too
bad
you
happen
to
have
a
house
on
the
road
oh
well
that
s
the
attitude
he
summited
he
s
just
descending
now
wonder
if
he
ll
try
the
48
one
could
argue
that
roads
ruined
everything
in
the
first
place
it
just
depends
on
how
far
back
in
time
you
want
to
go
with
nostalgia
i
used
to
live
in
durham
and
i
m
pretty
sure
i
know
which
house
you
re
talking
about
i
can
t
fully
agree
still
pedestrian
safety
should
take
precedence
over
car
capacity
or
asphalt
beauty
no
one
has
widened
the
main
streets
of
durham
though
some
of
those
buildings
have
been
there
for
centuries
if
anything
they
ve
been
narrowed
again
after
route
4
bypassed
the
town
the
crossings
have
been
remade
with
bricks
durham
is
probably
a
good
example
of
a
town
that
is
fighting
against
the
things
you
re
upset
about
it
could
be
an
industrial
disaster
with
the
near
buyout
from
onassis
instead
there
s
a
wagon
and
a
park
not
likely
he
was
left
with
a
shattered
face
and
a
huge
sar
bill
no
i
think
you
re
referring
to
the
other
side
of
the
town
but
that
s
a
good
example
as
well
and
that
would
have
been
a
disaster
had
it
gone
what
william
loeb
pushed
for
in
the
70
this
is
on
the
other
side
of
the
town
directly
on
the
old
mill
dam
almost
bought
the
last
remnant
of
one
of
the
gristmills
on
the
old
dam
but
the
road
leading
in
was
just
so
fucking
ugly
and
only
because
it
came
off
of
engineering
draw
board
as
everything
does
in
america
but
a
specifically
heavy
handed
in
new
hampshire
automobiles
first
and
their
engineering
need
x
amount
of
feet
for
the
turn
etc
to
continue
in
that
vein
of
automobile
worship
in
manchester
on
beech
street
there
was
a
magnificent
300
year
old
white
oak
it
existed
before
the
manchester
grid
appeared
in
the
19th
century
and
was
undoubtedly
a
boundary
marker
on
a
old
country
road
from
the
18th
century
maybe
the
tree
was
even
older
than
that
but
at
any
rate
it
managed
to
just
live
on
the
side
of
beach
street
on
the
back
of
an
industrial
building
and
i
always
marveled
at
it
that
it
survived
i
go
away
in
the
winter
these
days
and
i
came
back
and
the
fucking
tree
is
gone
what
did
they
replace
it
with
somebody
bought
the
building
and
the
engineers
got
to
work
so
many
square
feet
means
x
number
of
parking
spots
with
no
variants
they
needed
seven
spots
on
this
side
of
the
building
to
complete
the
plan
evidently
and
they
cut
the
fucking
tree
down
you
can
see
that
somebody
thought
about
it
for
2
minutes
because
the
concession
was
to
plant
two
new
trees
12
ft
away
and
guess
what
those
fucking
parking
spots
are
absolutely
never
used
this
is
the
kind
of
thinking
that
prevails
and
it
s
an
uphill
battle
to
fight
against
it
for
everything
if
you
live
in
a
wealthy
area
more
politically
active
and
aesthetically
conscious
historical
district
you
can
push
back
in
there
s
well
heeled
pockets
willing
to
do
it
for
their
sake
but
everywhere
else
does
it
emanate
from
the
state
down
absolutely
not
neanderthals
or
in
this
case
the
city
of
manchester
and
the
building
department
and
manchester
is
filled
with
those
kinds
of
road
solutions
traffic
solutions
that
i
speak
about
filled
with
them
granite
square
ex
mayor
mongen
s
pride
ripped
the
soul
out
of
the
historic
square
demolished
all
the
buildings
so
it
looks
like
a
piece
of
shit
that
could
be
in
north
st
louis
or
anywhere
else
garbage
usa
but
yet
when
you
enter
the
state
is
a
welcome
to
new
hampshire
sign
with
a
cute
little
stylized
village
that
we
like
to
pretend
it
s
still
cow
hampshire
rural
lovely
and
so
protected
anything
but
unfortunately
the
stone
one
where
they
redid
the
yard
lot
with
the
black
mulch
right
next
to
the
dam
i
know
the
whole
town
pretty
well
speaking
of
manchester
trees
there
s
one
next
to
the
brady
sullivan
tower
that
is
by
far
my
favorite
tree
in
the
state
just
look
at
this
beauty
https
maps
app
goo
gl
kvmc9bmht6acu49v6
i
definitely
agree
that
i
d
love
to
see
more
old
trees
in
the
state
but
again
if
you
go
back
far
enough
you
could
argue
that
humans
destroyed
the
entire
place
by
clear
cutting
it
for
centuries
i
still
think
there
are
plenty
of
towns
in
nh
that
are
just
as
you
are
envisioning
orford
rumney
eaton
hebron
they
re
tucked
away
off
the
beaten
path
fwiw
i
don
t
love
manchester
either
well
it
s
sad
because
manchester
is
the
economic
powerhouse
and
it
s
an
okay
city
i
still
live
there
but
it
shoots
itself
in
the
foot
every
chance
it
gets
ripping
away
part
of
its
heritage
and
take
it
away
it
s
beauty
if
only
saner
minds
had
ruled
in
the
1960s
the
upper
valley
is
indeed
a
little
more
sleepy
and
that
s
where
my
yankee
family
comes
from
the
town
of
unity
acworth
etc
the
old
stomping
ground
yes
that
s
a
lovely
copper
beach
on
the
side
of
the
old
carpenter
house
when
you
re
viewing
this
tree
do
you
have
any
knowledge
of
what
used
to
be
behind
the
viewer
where
the
brady
sullivan
tower
now
stands
this
is
the
poster
child
of
everything
that
i
could
complaining
about
i
can
go
into
a
long
rant
about
this
whole
area
and
how
it
was
simply
geographically
removed
in
1969
by
the
building
of
that
fucking
bridge
the
highway
ramps
the
complete
annihilation
on
the
other
side
of
the
river
of
the
original
mill
village
a
decade
before
that
and
the
crowning
jewel
that
used
to
be
about
50
ft
higher
with
a
parking
lot
is
the
entire
indian
bluff
burial
ground
that
was
crowned
with
the
finest
second
empire
house
north
of
boston
yeah
that
s
kind
of
manchester
in
the
20th
century
in
a
nutshell
it
means
it
s
actually
a
govt
operation
and
he
s
not
in
the
loop
i
m
more
surprised
that
smith
was
actually
in
nj
at
all
why
is
it
that
the
commander
of
the
coast
guard
is
giving
this
information
to
a
single
congressman
and
not
the
president
and
cabinet
the
simple
answer
as
to
why
nothing
is
being
done
is
because
those
in
power
to
do
something
already
know
it
is
our
own
military
doing
classified
testing
there
is
a
zero
percent
chance
another
country
has
been
flying
this
many
drones
over
nj
for
this
long
and
our
military
will
not
have
responded
to
capture
multiples
of
the
drones
so
the
fact
our
military
is
doing
nothing
about
them
means
either
they
aren
t
real
and
people
are
pointing
out
regular
airplanes
and
saying
they
are
drones
or
they
are
our
drones
chris
smith
and
a
sheriff
are
the
sources
both
are
elected
officials
with
no
obligation
to
tell
the
truth
to
the
public
meanwhile
news
orgs
need
double
sourcing
on
their
articles
and
evidence
at
least
the
reputable
ones
somebody
called
that
sheriff
and
he
couldn
t
back
it
up
beyond
this
is
what
i
m
hearing
the
coast
guard
patrol
boat
is
conveniently
unnamed
so
there
is
no
one
to
call
and
the
top
of
the
rumor
mountain
is
a
bland
congressman
of
one
of
our
least
educated
districts
trying
to
grandstand
in
a
party
full
of
mixed
nuts
what
s
the
factual
news
here
congressman
demands
things
doesn
t
smith
live
in
virginia
surprised
he
s
aware
of
the
issue
i
feel
like
this
is
the
new
crop
circle
skit
they
re
coming
from
an
offshore
carrier
ship
it
s
not
like
they
coming
out
the
sea
like
from
underwater
people
concerned
about
drones
need
to
study
the
histories
of
the
salem
witch
trials
and
satanic
panic
this
feels
like
jade
helm
15
conspiracies
for
nj
were
you
actually
paying
attention
to
how
many
drones
were
in
the
sky
before
everyone
started
talking
about
mysterious
drones
in
the
sky
there
s
a
lot
of
them
oh
some
were
near
a
bridge
yeah
bridges
are
nice
to
take
areal
photos
of
this
doesn
t
feel
like
a
real
thing
i
m
gonna
assume
that
a
random
congressperson
isn
t
briefed
on
military
actions
there
is
a
near
100
chance
these
drones
have
all
been
us
military
otherwise
they
would
have
been
dispatched
extremely
quickly
by
our
military
and
the
military
might
as
well
just
tell
everyone
in
the
country
to
fuck
right
off
because
we
don
t
have
the
right
to
ask
questions
about
national

been

many
people
have

their

at
some
point
went
out
mine
did
as
well
i
didn
t
think
much
of
it
till
i
was
with
other
people
from
around
the
county
and
neighboring
counties
and
all
of
them
said
their
internet
went
out
just
thought
it
was
interesting
and
curious
if
it
happen
to
others
not
from
the
area
and
hadn
t
heard
anything
about
this
until
just
now
i
saw
it
on
nbc
national

small
story
but
thats
where
i
first
heard
about
it
https

watch
v
ot9rrkygauu
it
s
the
enclave
seems
like
everyone
has
been
given
marching

governors
media
congress
persons
etc
have
been
saying
the
same
thing
there
is
no
threat
to
the
public
with
no
other
explanation
there
may
be
something
going
on
but
by
who
is
the
question
do
we
believe
van
drew
the
most
unbelievable
congress
person
from
the
state
did
he
not
get
the
memo
or
is
he
just
that
dense
just
waiting

suddenly
stop
with

this

modern

https

battle
of
los

the
boarder
is
open
to
drones
as
well
we
are
just
being
conditioned
to
ignore
them
so
when
the
actual
drone
invasion
happens
we
will
get
full
mitchell
versus
the
machines
but
with
no
mitchells
surprising
but
wait
to
see
more
in
coming
months
one
of
the
nhi
motherships
is
down
in
the
ocean
near
nj
so
that
is
where
it
manufactures
and
recalls
its
drones
maybe
the
phenomenon
will
go
away
on
its
own
but
this
time
it
feels
different
i
think
this
is
acclimization
until
the
mothership
armada
arrives
media
is
controlled
by
the
cia
that
s
the
truth
of
the
matter
they
don
t
want
this
getting
too
much
attention
local
news
has
been
okay
with
it
hopefully
it
s
our
government
however
our
current
administration
is
asleep
at
the
wheel
so
who
the
fuck
knows
what
s
going
on
up
there
ummmm
its
just
kids
w
toys
bingo
i
ve
personally
concluded
based
on
picking
up
bits
here
and
there
that
the
navy
is
conducting
tests
on
secret
experimental
drones
the
mic
is
siloed
and
is
not
about
to
go
telling
everyone
about
what
they
are
doing
the
media
is
loving
the
clicks
so
everything
is
what
s
going
on
in
new
jersey
fucking
dumb
i
don
t
understand
how
the
same
people
who
think
they
are
putting
chemicals
in
the
water
to
turn
the
frogs
gay
who
think
they
are
injecting
use
with
microchips
who
think
they
are
controlling
the
path
of
a
hurricane
are
suddenly
now
take
this
at
face
value
wondering
if
the
state
of
nj
is
a
safe
place
to
live
take
a
deep
breath
my
dudes
it
s
our
own
military
testing
something
out
albeit
in
a
sloppy
way
in
my
opinion
as
i
sit
here
sipping
my
coffee
there
s
no
reason
to
keep
congressmen
in
the
loop
on
this
odds
are
it
s
r
d
from
the
military
it
means
it
s
actually
a
govt
operation
and
he
s
not
in
the
loop
how
does
that
explain
the
private
news
media
not
reporting
on
a
sensational
story
line
that
s
their
business
model
it
s
how
they
make
money
here
s
a
congressman
reporting
during
a
congressional
hearing
that
the
sheriff
has
a
unit
of
detectives
who
detected
a
fleet
of
50
drones
coming
off
the
ocean
into
nj
and
the
media
stays
quiet
wtf
is
that
all
about
he
s
not
he
s
in
his
mansion
in
virginia
i
had
the
same
reaction
seeing
him
at
middletown
day
this
year
we
ll
start
hearing
press
releases
from
his
team
soon
regarding
labor
conditions
in
china
or
some
other
nonsense
he
has
absolutely
no
control
over
and
thus
isn
t
responsible
for
but
it
makes
his
voters
feel
good
because
r
newjersey
is
the
new
home
of
r
conspiracy
note
that
the
drone
bro
op
has
provided
no
link
to
any
source
at
all
and
we
are
taking
his
word
here
congress
approves
military
action
more
so
than
the
president
it
s
also
worth
noting
that
this
is
all
happening
near
trump
s
golf
course
secret
service
is
probably
there
as
we
speak
prepping
the
property
before
trump
goes
into
office
next
month
if
they
thought
there
was
a
danger
i
feel
like
they
d
be
getting
involved
not
necessarily
remember
the
unidentified
weather
balloons
that
were
flying
above
the
heartland
a
few
years
ago
that
turned
out
to
be
china
maybe
this
is
something
similar
to
test
our
defenses
classified
testing
in
full
view
of
the
public
us
government
has
tons
of
land
with
no
people
living
in
it
if
they
wanted
to
test
their
shinny
new
toys
chris
smith
who
didn
t
see
a
thing
because
he
doesn
t
live
here
lol
meanwhile
news
orgs
need
double
sourcing
on
their
articles
and
evidence
the
story
is
that
a
us
congressman
made
these
statements
in
a
public
hearing
on
video
on
live
cspan
they
don
t
need
double
and
triple
sources
to
report
what
a
us
congressman
said
in
a
public
hearing
so
why
are
they
silent
it
is
their
business
model
to
run
with
headline
grabbing
stories
why
are
they
acting
differently
now
watch
the
hearing
it
s
on
cspan
this
wasn
t
him
tweeting
some
conspiracy
theory
this
was
on
the
floor
of
congress
other
representatives
had
similar
questions
and
concerns
i
read
his
wikipedia
and
it
looks
like
he
is
very
trumpy
however
i
was
surprised
to
see
he
is
against
concealed
carry
so
he
is
not
100
a
dancing
clown
buffoon
like
most
right
wing
politicians
and
what
a
coincidence
lakehurst
navy
air
base
is
in
ocean
county
nj
people
concerned
about
drones
need
to
study
the
histories
of
the
salem
witch
trials
and
satanic
panic
we
as
a
country
and
as
a
people
learned
nothing
from
the
satanic
panic
in
fact
it
never
really
ended
just
laid
dormant
for
a
little
while
and
now
it
s
woken
up
from
its
nap
refreshed
and
re
energized
with
right
wing
lunatics
accusing
people
they
don
t
like
of
literally
being
demons
and
opening
demonic
portals
as
if
those
are
real
things
the
governor
says
its
real
he
says
he
was
told
by
homeland
security
that
the
drones
are
real
and
that
they
go
dark
when
homeland
security
attempts
to
track
them
with
homeland
security
or
military
equipment
i
an
72
years
old
lived
in
nj
all
my
life
i
have
zero
reason
to
disbelieve
the
governor
of
my
state
when
he
tells
me
this
shit
is
real
and
that
he
is
taking
this
deadly
seriously
the
thrust
of
my
post
is
why
isn
t
this
the
entire
news
story
of
the
day
this
morning
top
mast
of
every
newspaper
in
the
country
and
the
only
story
on
the
major
networks
this
is
back
in
2019
https

drone
swarms
that
harassed
navy
ships
demystified
in
new
documents
this
has
been
going
on
for
a
bit
perfectly
good
question
that
they
refuse
to
answer
rep
smith
also
spoke
to
the
commander
of
mcguire
air
force
base
who
told
him
they
have
the
capability
of
bringing
down
the
drones
but
aren
t
authorized
to
do
so
to
be
fair
the
coast
guard
is
homeland
security
and
the
military
army
navy
air
force
is
dod
govt
is
a
big
place
and
friendly
fire
due
to
lack
of
communication
resulting
in
loss
of
life
is
not
uncommon
unfortunately
so
a
drone
exercise
not
being
disclosed
to
a
random
coast
guard
ship
is
not
unlikely
especially
if
there
is
any
classification
tied
to
the
exercise
interesting
video
thanks
for
posting
fuck
don
t
start
with
nj
please
this
is
why
i
keep
listening
to
guerilla
radio
do
you
think
that
congressman
smith
is
at
all
worried
that
the
u
s
is
about
to
have
a
putin
asset
installed
in
the
white
house
agree
but
i
wonder
if
when
the
testing
exercises
are
completed
will
they
let
the
public
know
that
s
what
it
was
it
would
suck
if
the
drones
vanished
and
there
was
no
official
explanation
its
either
china
or
us
and
im
heavily
leaning
us
at
this
point
when
you
dive
down
the
rabbit
hole
of
us
drone
tech
development
law
recent
incursions
dating
to
2019
red
teams
war
games
etc
this
100
makes
sense
theres
so
much
valuable
development
information
to
do
an
operation
like
this
which
requires
basically
everybody
besides
those
at
the
tippy
top
to
know
and
that
includes
keeping
the
fbi
in
the
dark
public
reaction
is
also
key
to
this
trains
the
public
to
look
at
the
sky
more
and
act
as
a
first
defense
system
against
a
potential
enemy
on
top
of
local
police
reaction
local
leaders
and
the
fed
ability
to
deal
with
drones
from
a
criminal
element
like
90
this
is
us
10
its
china
which
means
wow
our
military
really
does
suck
lol
i
had
that
hought
in
my
head
this
morning
what
if
they
are
testing
single
and
dual
man
military
drones
that
drop
off
small
units
that
s
the
only
explanation
that
even
remotely
seems
plausible
at
this
point
but
why
in
such
populated
areas
why
not
test
these
away
from
the
public
how
do
you
know
they
aren
t
searching
for
something
has
there
ever
been
a
situation
where
navy
or
army
would
test
new
experimental
secret
hardware
all
over
small
towns
critical
infrastructure
why
would
they
do
this
they
re
trying
to
get
public
approval
of
a
higher
budget
it
s
all
a
bunch
of
bs
what
does
mic
is
siloed
mean
i
never
heard
those
terms
or
that
expression
absolute
horseshit
do
you
know
how
many
people
would
be
involved
in
those
tests
do
you
know
how
many
people
would
be
required
to
construct
manufacture
transport
and
test
these
drones
let
alone
operate
the
navy
ships
required
for
ocean
based
testing
your
explanation
is
a
conspiracy
theory
that
doesn
t
make
sense
way
too
many
people
would
be
involved
there
would
be
leaks
there
would
be
people
talking
drone
stuff
is
probably
about
trump
s
place
in
bedminster
or
immigrants
also
i
might
be
naive
but
i
am
pretty
confident
that
the
first
military
super
power
in
the
world
has
a
good
handle
on
its
airspace
zero
chance
of
an
undetected
invasion
is
it
sloppy
or
is
the
test
to
see
exactly
how
local
govt
and
populace
react
to
these
situations
i
mean
when
we
had
an
earthquake
they
reported
it
was
west
of
nyc
and
east
of
philly
suffice
to
say
i
m
not
shocked
let
s
just
call
it
weird
new
jersey
i
assumed
everyone
here
knew
about
yesterday
guess
not

it

this

that

it

took

t
going
to
do
it
over
the
mainland
and
waited
until
it
went
over
water
this
drone
thing
in
nj
has
been
going
on
longer
and
they
haven
t
identified
anything
which
means
exactly
what
everyone
else
is
saying
it
s
ours
over
north
jersey
i
mean
we
think
we
are
the
center
of
the
world
sure
but
we
are
not
that
important
its
a
us
military
operation
its
as
simple
as
that
you
mean
the
one
that
was
flying
around
during
trumps
previous
run
yes
a
balloon
most
likely
not
meant
for
the
us
cause
the
last
thing
you
want
is
for
your
enemy
to
get
your
recon
equipment
since
it
s
a
fucking
slow
ass
balloon
that
just
suggests
there
s
a
reason
it
needs
to
be
done
in
nj
vs
something
like
area
51
if
what
they
are
testing
is
the
ability
to
scan
heavily
populated
areas
then
yeah
it
makes
sense
to
do
it
in
nj
you
know
the
kind
of
testing
they
would
want
to
do
if
they
think
they
may
be
heading
into
a
possible
fight
over
cities
or
densely
populated
areas
like
if
for
instance
if
china
decides
to
invade
taiwan
while
we
are
all
busy
fighting
amongst
each
other
over
the
trump
administration
also
they
may
simply
not
care
if
the
public
sees
anything
and
it
is
more
convenient
to
keep
the
testing
near
where
the
work
is
being
done
like
for
instance
the
picatinny
arsenal
which
is
one
of
their
weapons
testing
facilities
just
because
they
don
t
care
if
the
public
sees
something
doesn
t
mean
they
are
going
to
openly
explain
what
they
are
doing
or
even
admit
they
are
doing
anything
at
all
because
backbencher
congressman
makes
demands
that
will
be
ignored
is
a
story
they
could
write
a
hundred
times
a
day
it
s
a
show
a
performance
until
he
drafts
up
a
bill
to
secure
funding
which
he
is
not
doing
lots
of
congress
people
say
lots
of
things
on
live
cspan
that
could
be
bigger
news
stories
but
aren
t
unless
their
particular
batch
of
nonsense
lines
up
with
somebody
with
a
platform
s
agenda
a
congressman
saying
he
heard
a
thing
from
a
guy
isn
t
inherently
page
1
news
i
was
surprised
to
see
he
is
against
concealed
carry
so
he
is
not
100
a
dancing
clown
buffoon
like
most
right
wing
politicians
why
would
anyone
be
against
ccw
doesn
t
make
any
sense
if
you
actually
know
the
stats
and
the
only
company
with
an
faa
permit
for
autonomous
drones
is
based
in
philly
and
their
ship
is
usually
docked
there
but
now
it
s
offshore
somewhere
launching
the
drones
because
the
drones
are
our
own
it
isn
t
bigger
news
since
there
is
no
video
there
are
no
videos
of
drones
that
depict
anything
unusual
or
anything
bigger
than
a
store
bought
drone
there
are
no
videos
you
can
prove
were
shot
recently
in
new
jersey
of
large
numbers
of
drones
all
we
ever
see
is
just
shots
with
at
most
two
count
them
two
drones
in
them
because
the
military
knows
what
it
is
what
is
your
best
guess
what
do
you
believe
is
the
most
straight
forward
answer
there
won
t
be
look
up
colorado
drone
swarm
at
this
point
maybe
sooner
than
later
if
we
do
would
be
kinda
hard
to
just
be
like
thank
you
all
for
coming
today
to
this
press
briefing
on
the
drone
invasion
and
what
i
can
report
the
drones
are
gone
thank
you
for
coming
don
t
hold
your
breath
it
ll
come
out
in
30
years
after
declassification
and
foia
request
a
simple
statement
saying
this
is
a
test
by
a
us
government
department
of
technology
just
to
shut
up
all
the
noise
instead
they
play
stupid
and
it
only
makes
the
noise
louder
maybe
these
drones
are
designed
to
collect
data
or
perform
observations
over
populated
areas
it
s
kind
of
difficult
to
create
a
test
on
such
a
scale
nj
has
offshore
ships
and
tons
of
military
bases
maybe
they
flew
over
picatinny
in
collaboration
i
just
believe
that
to
think
it
s
not
military
is
just
drifting
into
conspiracy
sort
of
like
how
area
51
is
filled
with
aliens
which
may
be
true
but
in
reality
it
s
just
experimental
technology
being
tested
edit
to
add
we
don
t
know
if
there
are
feet
on
the
ground
attributing
to
the
testing
maybe
it
s
field
comms
where
soldiers
can
be
directed
or
speak
across
secure
lines
because
they
probably
already
completed
those
tests
operation
sea
spray
is
just
one
instance
that
comes
immediately
to
my
mind
so
yeah
110
edit
the
difference
is
in
sea
spray
they
unleashed
biological
contaminants
on
san
francisco
people
this
is
really
not
as
far
fetched
as
you
think

https

wiki
unethical
human
experimentation
in

i
m
guessing
it
means
that
knowledge
of
the
secret
operation
is
restricted
siloed
to
the
man
in
charge
mic
of
the
operation
how
many
people
let
s
hear
what
you
have
to
say
it
s
almost
as
if
you
have
no
idea
about
the
mic
but
i
m
willing
to
listen
lol
if
you
think
that
s
horseshit
i
can
only
imagine
the
alternative
theory
you
d
be
willing
to
offer
they
are
being
spotted
all
over
the
place
and
not
just
focused
there
why
trump
s
place
in
nj
now
though
trump
will
be
in
the
white
house
for
the
nxt
4
years
you
d
think
the
drones
would
be
in
dc
it
wasn
t
that
long
ago
that
the
military
was
scrambling
fighter
jets
and
shooting
down
weather
balloons
meandering
over
our
airspace
zero
chance
that
they
re
allowing
unknown
swarms
of
drones
to
just
do
their
own
thing
if
they
re
flying
around
trump
s
golf
courses
it
s
likely
a
test
of
whatever
drone
detection
system
is
being
installed
to
protect
the
president
in
the
event
that
someone
does
try
to
fly
a
drone
over
and
pop
him
while
he
s
playing
golf
on
one
of
his
200
golf
days
a
year
it
would
be
somewhat
unfortunate
if
we
didn
t
have
a
way
to
know
that
a
drone
army
is
showing
up
near
the
most
densely
populated
area
in
the
country
in
any
capacity
as
well
so
it
wouldn
t
shock
me
if
there
s
something
being
installed
on
the
coast
lately
that
they
need
to
test
and
you
don
t
really
just
put
it
in
and
hope
for
the
best
when
people
s
lives
are
at
stake
but
you
also
probably
don
t
want
it
being
front
page
news
that
now
there
s
a
system
that
detects
drones
so
get
to
work
cracking
that
tech
probably
similar
to
missile
defense
systems
where
nobody
s
really
sure
what
kind
of
capability
we
have
to
knock
a
nuke
out
of
the
sky
before
it
leaves
russian
chinese
korean
space
that
s
a
good
point
i
was
thinking
earlier
that
this
could
be
a
test
on
how
willing
civilians
are
to
call
in
things
to
the
fbi
so
similar
vein
you
assumed
everyone
knew
but
the
whole
point
of
this
post
is
why
didn
t
anybody
know
i
m
as
confused
as
the
people
gazing
up
at
the
drones
sorry
skippy
nobody
is
going
to
watch
two
hours
of
video
looking
for
the
moment
in
it
that
you
have
chosen
to
misrepresent
can
you
give
me
the
time
stamp
where
we
hear
the
testimony
you
claim
they
are
usually
briefed
that
hearing
yesterday
was
very
interesting
and
eye
opening
theres
a
giant
beurocratic
chain
of
command
when
it
comes
to
the
military
reacting
to
an
immediate
threat
on
the
homeland
this
has
been
going
on
here
in
nj
since
november
it
s
just
seems
to
catch
on
and
ramp
up
the
last
few
weeks
we
have
several
based
including
specifically
the
arsenal
that
does
research
the
chinese
spy
balloon
that
was
2023
so
biden
was
in
office
almost
2
years
ago
time
is
doing
something
weird
i
m
old
ugh
do
you
have
a
source
for
this
my
parents
are
losing
their
minds
over
these
drones
and
i
want
to
tell
them
about
this
so
they
ll
stfu
my
question
isn
t
why
the
media
isn
t
reporting
about
the
drones
my
question
is
why
the
media
isn
t
reporting
that
a
us
congressman
claims
the
ocean
county
sheriff
has
equipment
that
detected
50
drones
flying
into
nj
from
offshore
and
also
claims
the
us
coast
guard
told
smith
that
their
nj
coast
guard
patrol
was
followed
by
12
30
drones
a
us
congressman
making
those
claims
in
a
public
congressional
hearing
is
a
huge
story
but
one
the
media
prone
to
sensationalism
is
ignoring
presumably
the
news
media
is
interested
in
making
money
they
chase
the
most
sensational
stories
of
the
day
by
creating
huge
headlines
what
could
be
more
sensational
than
a
sitting
us
congressman
reporting
that
the
ocean
county
sheriff
s
department
has
recorded
evidence
of
a
fleet
of
50
drones
flying
into
nj
from
the
atlantic
ocean
i
suspect
you
want
me
to
believe
that
ever
newspaper
in
the
world
is
obeying
orders
of
the
cia
but
that
is
way
too
much
of
a
conspiracy
for
me
to
believe
is
that
what
you
believe
that
every
major
newspaper
is
being
silent
out
of
fear
of
the
cia
i
lived
in
colorado
when
this
was
happening
and
was
shocked
that
there
was
no
follow
up
then
again
with
all
the
defense
contractors
out
there
plus
the
various
military
installations
that
regularly
flew
military
aircrafts
buckley
air
force
academy
and
the
rural
locations
we
all
just
kind
of
chalked
it
up
to
something
secret
the
nj
stuff
is
way
crazier
because
it
s
such
a
heavily
populated
area
as
someone
who
grew
up
in
north
jersey
during
after
9
11
i
refuse
to
believe
that
the
american
military
would
allow
unknown
aircraft
drones
to
fly
anywhere
near
nyc
so
casually
military
industrial
complex

won

a

a

additionally
an

officer
observed
more
than
50
drones
approaching

rep
smith
expressed
concerns
about
the
potential
involvement
of
foreign
entities
such
as
russia
or
china
in
these
provocative
drone
activities
he
has
urged

to
deploy
resources
from

mcguire
dix
lakehurst
to
investigate
these
incidents
and
if
necessary
neutralize

i
m
right
in
the
middle
of
it
in
central
nj
and
i
went
and
looked
on
our
town
s
fb
group
yesterday
and
the
first
mention
of
mysterious
drones
was
on
november
27th
that
was
2
weeks
ago
today
can
you
find
an
earlier
confirmed
date
than
that
edit
i
stand
corrected
i
found
a
reddit
posts
about
drone
sighting
in
nj
and
bucks
county
pa
going
back
to
the
first
week
of
november
it
s
been
going
on
longer
than
i
thought
i
started
seeing
them
around
the
northern
lights
display
because
that
s
when
i
started
going
out
and
really
looking
at
the
sky
for
extended
periods
of
time
and
that
was
on
october
10th
it
has
ramped
up
though
in
activity
the
past
2
3
weeks
so
exactly
the
kind
of
bases
that
would
be
conducting
military
drone
testing
no
i
aint
got
no
source
tell
them
to
calm
down
ask
them
if
the
military
ever
admitted
to
the
existence
of
stealth
fighters
and
new
planes
during
testing
periods
this
company
uses
vtol
style
wings
so
it
looks
like
a
predator
drone
in
flight
why
they
re
all
being
mistaken
for
planes
but
can
swivel
their
wings
and
hover
the
fact
they
re
flying
over
critical
infrastructure
and
military
locations
is
all
u
need
to
know
the
people
crying
about
china
and
russia
is
hilarious
do
they
really
think
we
d
allow
drones
to
come
and
map
all
our
sensitive
soft
targets
every
night
for
weeks
nevermind
the
fact
that
they
wouldn
t
be
able
to
control
drones
over
our
soil
like
that
anyways
are
you
new
to
paying
attention
to
the
news
skippy
in
the
last
month
the
governments
of
germany
and
france
both
fell
and
it
has
received
less
press
than
your
dumb
drone
issue
believe
me
the
drones
are
getting
way
more
than
their
fair
share
of
coverage
gosh
it
s
almost
like
your
absurd
bias
against
the
sensationalist
media
is
being
proven
wrong
and
maybe
just
maybe
some
of
the
things
you
think
have
been
sensationalist
over
the
decades
have
just
been
regular
factual
news
you
didn
t
want
to
accept
or
maybe
because
it
is
the
2nd
or
3rd
hand
word
of
a
kooky
member
of
congress
and
not
the
actual
authorities
that
are
relaying
it
has
the
ocean
county
sheriff
s
office
confirmed
the
report
themselves
i
actually
don
t
believe
the
cia
has
anything
to
do
with
it
i
just
believe
there
is
a
ton
of
fear
mongering
and
the
want
to
be
relevant
by
politicians
seems
the
most
logical
i
actually
believe
that
if
there
was
a
drone
invasion
it
would
be
leaked
in
a
heartbeat
and
on
the
nyt
yup
the
only
way
this
is
allowed
is
if
they
are
in
control
of
the
situation
there
is
no
shot
these
things
even
make
it
here
in
the
first
place
if
they
re
coming
from
the
ocean
then
we
are
testing
naval
deployment
of
them
you
bust
class
b
airspace
in
nj
while
flying
a
small
plane
and
the
gates
of
hell
would
open
up
on
you
yeah
that
makes
more
sense
fair
but
he
s
generally
at
maralago
all
winter
and
only
in
nj
during
the
summer
just
seems
odd
for
these
to
be
largely
based
in
morris
county
so
you
have
nothing
got
it
this
is
what
happens
every
time
you
ask
to
see
video
from
the
drone
bros
the
politician
in
question
offers
zero
proof
of
anything
in
his
statements
and
just
says
he
heard
from
a
guy
that
they
saw
something
if
there
were
crew
on
a
coast
guard
vessel
followed
by
fifty
drones
there
100
would
be
video
of
this
and
there
is
none
here
is
some
video
from
the
ocean
county
sharifs
department
and
what
do
we
actually
see
a
single
drone
with
no
establishing
background
features
to
give
it
any
context
at
all
then
it
cuts
to
a
shot
of
some
dimwit
cops
speculating
the
two
dimwit
cops
are
the
stand
in
for
all
the
drone
bros
like
they
are
your
spirit

night
the
last
week
and
he
has
been
saying
that
he
and
his
team
he
has
guests
on
have
been
on
this
for
a
month
the
guardian
said
early
november
at
the
end
of
the
day
who
knows
i
think
they
ve
probably
been
around
but
more
people
are
just
looking
up
now
was
it
not
late
october
that
picattinny
had
drones
over
it
military
bases
that
nj
has
a
lot
of
edit
i
misread
the
comment
and
thought
they
were
asking
what
kind
of
bases
oopsie
you
don
t
need
an
airstrip
sir
rotfl
that
s
what
i
told
them
these
things
would
have
been
shot
out
of
the
air
if
the
government
didn
t
want
them
there
their
response
was
well
not
with
this
administration
so
they
re
too
far
gone
at
this
point
oh
well
so
you
just
making
shit
up
without
a
source
my
question
is
why
is
the
media
ignoring
the
story
since
when
does
the
private
media
who
is
interested
in
making
money
by
attracting
viewers
to
sensational
stories
not
reporting
on
a
us
congressman
saying
50
drones
flew
in
from
off
shore
the
non
action
of
the
media
is
what
is
so
puzzling
and
interesting
and
is
the
thrust
of
my
post
any
thoughts
on
how
a
media
that
has
always
been
interested
in
sensationalism
has
suddenly
gone
quiet
but
my
question
is
why
is
the
private
media
ignoring
one
of
the
most
sensational
headline
grabbing
stories
possible
they
never
ignore
sensational
stories
why
this
time
that
was
my
post
you
asked
me
what
i
believe
to
be
the
most
forward
answer
implying
that
there
was
one
and
that
i
should
know
it
so
i
m
asking
you
why
is
the
private
media
suddenly
not
reporting
on
a
sensational
story
that
history
shows
they
always
jump
all
over
why
are
they
testing
these
secret
things
so
close
to
the
most
densely
populated
area
of
the
country
and
what
s
so
secret
about
a
group
of
drones
anyway
yeah
ok
tell
them
to
go
fly
a
drone
by
an
airport
or
nfl
stadium
and
see
what
happens
to
it
also
ask
them
about
the
fact
that
they
have
oh
i
dont
know
literally
faa
compliant
lighting
on
them
didnt
realize
ufos
or
stealth
attack
drones
would
have
red
green
wingtip
lights
and
white
strobes
on
them
but
no
it
must
be
sleepy
joe
s
fault
their
tds
is
real
and
im
sorry
because
smith
is
saying
that
someone
the
o
c
sheriff
told
him
that
someone
unidentified
rando
told
him
they
saw
it
as
far
as
i
know
the
sheriff
hasn
t
gone
on
record
to
confirm
smith
s
statement
the
media
isn
t
ignoring
the
story
as
noted
the
local
paper
covered
it
but
without
anyone
willing
to
go
on
the
record
there
isn
t
anything
more
to
report
it
is
not
a
story
is
the
most
likely
answer
you
have
been
given
the
answer
over
and
over
and
are
ignoring
the
answer
because
the
answer
doesn
t
fit
under
your
tinfoil
hat
maybe
they
are
testing
equipment
they
want
to
use
in
densely
populated
areas
of
foreign
territories
i
mean
there
s
lots
of
reasons
the
military
would
do
things
and
not
tell
every
single
american
citizen
the
reality
is
what
we
do
know
is
already
5
10
years
old
anyways
so
if
this
is
the
u
s
these
arent
new
technology
that
we
re
being
exposed
to
i
m
sure
the
military
or
mic
has
all
sorts
of
rationale
for
doing
what
they
do
they
don
t
contemplate
or
perceive
things
the
way
ordinary
people
do
it
s
also
possible
that
gauging
public
reaction
is
part
of
the
testing
maybe
the
goal
is
to
see
how
drones
do
in
a
heavily
populated
area
want
to
make
sure
the
signals
to
and
from
the
drones
can
handle
heavy
amount
of
interference
in
the
air
they
re
probably
based
out
of
jbmdl
the
setting
is
an
integral
part
of
the
test
frankly
a
bigger
news
item
would
be
a
headline
like
this
ocean
county
sherif
department
devotes
resources
to
investigate
conspiracy
theory
presents
zero
evidence
for
outlandish
claims
and
the
story
would
ask
why
sherifs
officers
were
investigating
something
yet
brought
no
equipment
to
record
anything
not
even
a
smart
phone
just
like
hunter
s
laptop
being
obviously
fake
which
is
why
we
should
be
outraged
don
t
let
them
turn
us
into
a
country
with
omnipresent
drone
surveillance
we
got
to
play
the
beta
shit
on
it
relentlessly
so
that
we
dont
let
this
reach
full
release
hi
i
started
a
new
subreddit
dedicated
to
advocating
and
promoting
micro
mobility
projects
in
nj
we
can
discuss
all
things
bike
public
transit
infrastructure
etc
all
geared
towards
having
healthy
and
productive
discussion
regarding
getting

staten
join
me

micromobilitynj
wtf
is
going
on
with
all
these
drones
i
haven
t
seen
any
myself
but
i
m
so
confused
will
we
have
legit
bread
and
milk
days
this
december
anybody
know
what
happened
on

it
was
basically
stand
still
traffic
for
at
least
an
hour
then
suddenly
it
just
started
flowing
again
i
saw
a
few
cop
cars
flying
up
the
shoulder
but
that
was
it
whatever
happened
must
ve
been
totally
cleared
by
the
time
i
started
moving
again
over
the
past
year
i
ve
been
sharing
videos
about
everything
that
makes
south

special
through
my

now
i
m
thrilled
to

where
are
the

punks
getting
a

in

i
m
calling
on
all
my
fellow
citizens
to
flip
off
scott
presler
if
you
see
him
in
our
great
state
i
got
my
flu
and
covid
shots
in
october
but
i
ve
been
sick
with
the
flu
since
thursday
it
struck
me
literally
at
thanksgiving
dinner
is
there
a
new
strain
or
mutation
that
cropped
up
it
s
a
clear
night
go
drive
to
somerset
county
and
see
i
can
confirm
1
in
hillsboro
my
friend
just
saw
his
first
one
i
m
at
dinner
up
in
newark
and
didn
t
see
any
driving
up
during
the
day
but
im
positive
i
will
have
a
few
waiting
for
me
when
i
get
home
in
warren
i
think
it
s
really
important
to
witness
this
unprecedented
event
navy
doing
vtol
drone
flights
https

reel
ddvuvntn1wr
igsh
aw9yc2liy3d5ow41
similar
to
how
private
companies
can
operate
driverless
cars
in
california
the
navy
has
drones
that
are
safe
and
reliable
to
fly
over
us
in
faa
airspace
and
so
they
are
beginning
to
do
so
we
ll
see
more
and
more
of
this
in
years
to
come
if
you
want
to
get
the
full
drone
experience
hike
your
way
up
to
passaic
county
and
go
to
a
hilly
place
i
can
see
the
whole
town
from
my
place
which
became
a
curse
when
i
could
monitor
the
sky
for
miles
i
counted
11
drones
in
the
sky
last
night
this
stuff
is
out
of
hand
maybe
for
the
first
potential
storm
but
the
storms
are
going
to
be
very
few
feels
like
it
it
was
too
much
trouble
for
them
to
issue
a
statement
saying
yeah
sorry
guys
that
s
us
and
why
test
prototype
drones
over
the
civilian
population
mr
fulop
is
scheduled
for
2pm

what
are
your
thoughts
on
making
public
transit
usable
to
get
around
the
state
vs
just
going
to
nyc
or
philly
if
i
want
to
get
down
the
shore
from
most
places
i
can
either
drive
or
have
to
take
a
train
to
secaucus
and
go
back
down
we
ve
got
driving
infrastructure
how
can
we
have
public
transit
that
actually
lets
people
get
around
the
states
nj
is
the
densest
state
in
the
nation
and
yet
most
of
the
state
requires
a
car
to
access
what
will
you
do
as
governor
to
improve
alternative
modes
of
transport
like
public
transit
bike
pedestrian
infrastructure
within
the
state
not
just
for
commuting
to
nyc
philly
to
reduce
the
gridlock
on
our
roads
if
you
become
governor
is
single
payer
state
health
insurance
something
you
would
look
into
implementing
any
thoughts
on
merging
municipalities
services
to
keep
costs
down
like
north
hudson
fire
department
has
done
what
is
your
elevator
pitch
of
things
you
know
you
d
be
able
to
fix
it
you
are
elected
what
do
you
consider
the
murphy
administration
s
best
policy
achievement
on
what
policy
would
you
say
the
administration
fell
disappointingly
short
do
you
believe
the
state
s
stringent
allotment
of
liquor
licenses
is
really
beneficial
to
local
businesses
and
or
residents
how
are
new
restaurants
expected
to
thrive
if
they
don
t
have
the
capital
or
let
s
be
honest
here
connections
to
obtain
a
liquor
license
better
yet
why
are
there
breweries
and
distilleries
in
the
state
that
are
allowed
to
serve
people
liquor
but
not
food
do
you
think
this
is
a
problem
given
how
many
people
then
get
in
their
cars
and
drive
home
what
exactly
is
your
plan
for
the
housing
crisis
in
nj
new
condos
and
apartments
are
not
fixing
the
lack
of
first
time
homes
while
corporations
investors
ae
not
only
outbidding
but
entirely
breaking
the
pricing
structure
as
of
now
a
4
bedroom
2
5
family
home
middlesex
county
and
neon
is
averaging
650
700k
it
seems
impossible
right
now
for
anyone
without
equity
pre
2020
to
even
get
their
feet
wet
i
just
wanna
take
the
nj
transit
to
work
without
gambling
on
whether
it
ll
work
or
not
it
s
a
bare
minimum
i
just
wanna
go
to
work
gif
emote
free
emotes
pack
sob
as
governor
what
specific
things
do
you
plan
on
doing
to
fix
the
constant
issues
with
the
train
for
thousands
of
commuters
what
politicians
or
states
do
you
look
to
for
inspiration
or
as
an
example
of
who
you
would
want
to
govern
like
what
is
your
proudest
accomplishment
as
mayor
of
jersey
city
what
is
your
biggest
regret
what
is
your
plan
to
address
the
cost
of
living
crisis
in
new
jersey
i
m
24
years
old
and
i
m
not
sure
if
i
ll
ever
be
able
to
afford
my
own
apartment
let
alone
buy
a
house
in
new
jersey
this
is
probably
the
biggest
issue
democrats
are
facing
nationwide
and
they
ve
shown
little
interest
in
doing
anything
to
stop
it
i
read
a
brief
synopsis
on
your
feeling
nj
has
too
much
government
this
was
in
reference
to
property
taxes
your
response
was
that
trenton
needs
to
reform
our
layers
of
government
to
paraphrase
can
you
elaborate
and
how
the
heck
would
you
move
it
through
the
entrenched
interests
btw
i
agree
i
think
county
governments
in
particular
are
bloated
and
often
redundant
new
jersey
has
565
municipalities
many
of
which
are
small
and
have
duplicative
services
contributing
to
high
property
taxes
and
inefficiencies
would
you
support
efforts
to
mandate
municipal
consolidation
to
reduce
redundancy
and
lower
costs
for
taxpayers
edit
while
the
governor
may
not
have
the
authority
to
directly
consolidate
municipalities
you
could
influence
the
legislature
and
use
tools
like
conditional
funding
or
state
aid
to
encourage
consolidation
would
you
be
willing
to
use
your
executive
power
to
push
for
policies
that
reduce
the
number
of
municipalities
and
address
the
inefficiencies
driving
up
property
taxes
how
will
you
help
support
teachers
and
education
in
the
state
how
are
you
going
to
get
more
housing
built
of
all
types
single
family
multi
family
mixed
use
etc
housing
and
renting
costs
are
completely
out
of
control
and
there
s
not
enough
supply
to
handle
demand
new
housing
is
generally
focused
on
single
family
and
luxury
apartments
even
these
are
not
being
built
fast
enough
because
every
municipality
has
power
to
set
its
zoning
what
will
you
do
to
encourage
municipalities
to
build
renovate
more
do
you
plan
on
upholding
the
hiring
promotion
freeze
for
state
employees
introduced
by
murphy
what
do
you
think
of
the
fact
that
our
state
pays
employees
less
than
the
amount
required
to
actually
live
in
this
state
with
so
many
state
jobs
paying
in
the
range
of
45k
50k
do
you
have
any
plans
to
fix
that
how
can
we
help
camden
and
trenton
have
the
same
economic
success
that
jersey
city
is
having
not
sure
if
this
comes
under
government
but
there
is
a
medical
crisis
in
nj
it
is
ridiculously
hard
to
find
a
doctor
as
a
new
patient
even
finding
a
primary
care
doctor
is
not
easy
emergency
care
is
broken
as
well
since
covid
is
there
a
way
we
can
add
more
doctors
and
healthcare
professionals
so
that
we
can
reduce
the
wait
time
what
s
the
deal
with
the
drones
if
you
are
not
the
democratic
nominee
how
will
you
be
supporting
the
nominee
to
ensure
we
keep
a
democrat
in
the
governor
s
seat
will
you
still
be
working
for
the
candidates
running
down
your
slate
if
they
get
nominated
and
you
do
not
if
you
re
actually
against
political
bosses
and
the
machine
can
you
explain
why
it
was
acceptable
for
you
to
support
one
of
the
biggest
political
bosses
in
the
state
brian
stack
as
the
hudson
county
executive
and
why
was
it
okay
for
you
to
place
amy
degise
the
head
of
the
hudson
county
democratic
organization
on
your
ticket
last
election
you
seem
to
love
attacking
every
other
candidate
for
benefiting
from
the
system
but
as
a
resident
of
jersey
city
who
has
voted
for
you
all
three
times
you
ran
i
ve
seen
you
do
it
many
times
too
wage
disparity
is
arguably
the
number
one
issue
facing
america
right
now
the
rich
just
get
richer
and
everyone
else
is
basically
standing
still
by
comparison
with
nyc
and
wall
street
being
a
big
part
of
why
this
is
happening
what
realistic
things
can
will
you
try
to
implement
to
help
us
normies
or
should
we
expect
more
or
the
status
quo
from
you
aka
doing
absolutely
nothing
hello
mayor
living
in
jersey
city
really
showed
me
how
awful
public
transit
is
in
nj
with
that
being
said
how
do
you
plan
on
fixing
nj
transit
and
modernizing
it
as
well
as
working
the
port
authority
to
improve
path
service
as
it
has
degraded
year
over
year
with
no
signs
of
improvement
how
can
reckless
development
be
addressed
on
a
state
level
from
going
to
local
municipal
meetings
it
seems
as
long
as
developers
meet
whatever
standards
exist
that
little
can
be
done
to
stop
them
from
slapping
down
more
concrete
monstrosities
such
as
last
mile
warehouses
in
residential
neighborhoods
is
it
possible
that
a
state
level
legislation
could
be
put
forth
to
allow
the
will
of
residents
to
prevail
over
these
developers
in
three
sentences
please
tell
us
how
you
plan
to
support
new
jersey
s
libraries
and
librarians
should
we
have
a
statewide
law
to
eliminate
minimum
parking
requirements
like
minnesota
recently
passed
do
you
feel
the
use
of
super
pacs
by
candidates
to
be
a
morally
objectionable
path
to
take
in
regard
to
campaign
financing
why
or
why
not
one
more
what
are
your
thoughts

your

doc

this
is
a
hot
topic
curious
what
your
take
on
preschool
is
i
imagine
your

is
only
looking

subsidize
daycare
costs
do
you
support
or
have
a
plan
to
implement
universal
free
preschool
in

if
so
will
this
be

any
opinion
on
increasing
the

150k

low

the

here
new
jersey
s
farmland
preservation
program
has
been
a
crucial
tool
in

how

do
you
have
any

expand
the

jersey
city
rents
have
exploded
displacing
longterm
residents
and
making
this
town
unaffordable
for
all
but
the
wealthiest
newcomers
furthermore
almost
everything
being
built
is
a
luxury
rental
and
houses
that
were
owned
and
previously
could
be
purchased
and
fixed
up
by
average
people
are
being
knocked
down
to
build
very
expensive
condos
and
luxury
highrises
why
have
you
allowed
this
to
happen
in
jersey
city
and
do
you
have
a
plan
to
make
home
ownership
in
nj
affordable
for
people
earning
minimum
wage
because
we
can
all
agree
that
people
earning
minimum
wage
deserve
to
live
in
nj
too
right
how
can
nj
best
prepare
for
mass
automation
in
the
private
sector
over
the
next
governor
s
terms
what
are
your
thoughts
on
towns
that
enjoy
higher
property
value
due
to
a
local
train
but
at
the
same
time
ban
adjacent
out
of
towners
from
parking
their
cars
to
take
said
train
essentially
creating
a
private
train
for
a
small
subset
of
njers
do
you
believe
towns
should
be
forced
to
host
a
park

or
risk
their

down
what
will
you

about

our

have
you

are
ypu

hey
mayor
fulop
thanks
for
throwing
your
hat
in
the
ring
and
i
appreciate
your
acknowledgement
that
new
housing
construction
is
one
of
many
tools
we
need
to
use
to
keep
nj
affordable
i
m
wondering
what
your
thoughts
are
on
reforms
to
new
jersey
s
reliance
on
property
taxation
to
fund
localities
i
know
you
ve
got
a
payroll
tax
in
jersey
city
that
s
had
some
success
what
other
funding
sources
would
you
be
open
to
allowing
localities
and
counties
to
tap
into
outside
of
the
property
tax
additionally
i
know
jersey
city
s
revaluation
in
2017
was
incredibly
difficult
both
to
implement
and
politically
painful
but
it
made
property
taxation
in
the
city
fairer
are
you
open
to
mandating
annual
reassessments
revaluations
to
ensure
the
property
tax
remains
as
fair
as
it
can
how
are
you
going
to
fix
the
housing
crisis
i
do
not
believe
there
should
be
a
reality
in
where
a
roach
infested
studio
should
go
for
nearly
2k
a
month
where
are
regular
people
making
median
income
supposed
to
live
are
you
going
to
continue
fully
funding
pers
i
work
as
a
contractor
for
a
data
center
where
i
don
t
get
paid
for
taking
a
vacation
as
governor
would
you
sign
a
bill
to
allow
contract
workers
such
as
myself
1
week
paid
vacation
i
was
able
to
get
paid
sick
time
thanks
to
murphy
are
you
ready
to
fight
for
us
the
federal
government
is
going
to
be
very
hostile
toward
blue
states
for
at
least
the
next
four
years
idk
if
you
could
answer
this
but
what
are
your
thoughts
on
student
loans
and
how
difficult
it
is
for
repayment
and
forgiveness
society
thinks
student
loan
holders
are
young
men
and
women
but
the
majority
of
loan
owners
are
middle
age
or
older
who
came
from
working
class
families
who
are
still
paying
off
to
this
day
i
m
still
having
issues
with
payments
with
loans
that
was
generated
when
gw
bush
was
president
what
are
your
goals
for
education
and
educators
what
are
the
policies
and
ideas
you
are
bringing
regarding
lower
rental
costs
as
well
as
home
costs
rent
is
absolutely
crushing
to
just
be
able
to
put
a
decent
roof
over
my
family
s
head
i
won
t
ask
about
child
care
because
that
may
be
a
mess
depending
what
the
president
does
with
the
block
grant
for
child
care
ccdbg
how
do
you
expect
to
compete
with
a
corporate
backed
democratic
machine
backed
josh
gottheimer
who
already
has
millions
in
his
war
chest
seems
like
the
deck
is
stacked
against
you
and
the
other
democratic
candidates
how
do
you
see
the
current
state
of
hudson
county
democrats
and
how
do
you
differ
from
the
corrupt
machine
that
is
the
northeast
nj
democratic
party
how
would
you
right
now
approach
this
mysterious
drone
issue
as
mayor
of
jersey
city
you
dealt
with
nyc
s
haredi
community
when
they
grew
large
enough
to
expand
across
the
river
and
some
clashes
that
occurred
can
you
explain
how
you
walked
the
fine
line
of
trying
to
guide
diverse
communities
to
find
common
ground
and
what
is
a
governor
s
role
in
balancing
a
sensitive
issue
like
this
on
the
local
level
and
making
sure
different
communities
have
mutual
understandings
or
is
it
a
zero
sum
game
thanks
for
doing
this
edit
grammar
what
train
routes
would
you
explore
creating
by
using
existing
rails
as
governor
will
you
be
able
to
tell
us
what
the
real
deal
is
with
these
drones
good
afternoon
i
know
you
ve
got
a
reputation
as
pro
transit
especially
by
comparison
to
other
candidates
i
ll
keep
it
to
a
few
specifics
and
a
broad
question
what
are
your
thoughts
on
the
glassboro
camden
line
and
do
you
think
you
d
give
consideration
to
modifying
the
plan
to
instead
operate
vehicles
compatible
with
the
existing
pacto
line
to
provide
direct
access
to
philadelphia
electrification
of
transit
both
for
operational
and
environmental
benefits
has
been
successful
both
historically
and
in
recent
events
caltrain
s
recent
project
some
njt
routes
like
the
coast
line
are
already
partly
electrified
needing
diesels
only
for
the
last
sections
would
you
support
extending
the
wires
on
more
nj
transit
lines
on
the
bus
front
how
realistic
would
a
general
improvement
in
frequencies
be
on
some
local
routes
many
run
only
once
per
hour
and
are
of
limited
utility
as
a
result
especially
when
trying
to
transfer
to
other
transit
lines
thanks
for
doing
an
ama
your
policies
on
your
campaign
site
are
thorough
and
well
thought
out
but
we
are
due
to
swing
back

what

are
you
using

grab

how

you

then
what
will
you

this
includes

you

what
are
your

on
giving

to
large
developers
to
build

would
the

break

reflect
the
amount
of

driving
in
the

has
become
horrifying
and
dangerous
just
this
morning
on
my
30
minute
commute
a
car
drove
through
oncoming
traffic
to
pass
other
cars
turning
and
nearly
caused
a
crash
as
he
cut
through
into
traffic
then
another
car
drove
through
the
shoulder
to
make
a
left
turn
in
front
of
people
in
the
left
lane
and
then
someone
tried
to
cut
me
off
on
a
merger
and
nearly
drove
me
off
the
road
how
can
we
decrease
the
traffic
on
the
roads
and
make
it
safe
to
drive
again
our
state
isn
t
doing
anything
to
develop
housing
for
families
with
kids
and
our
administrators
are
passing
tax
incentives
to
keep
elderly
in
their
homes
longer
further
decreasing
the
supply
of

developers
purchase
every
starter
home
that
comes
on

to
convert
them

what
do
you
propose
we
can
do
to
make
new

affordable
for
middle

again
you

if
you
get

how
will
you
unify

to
ensure

in

it
s
seems
most
housing
development
in
jersey
city
are
apartment

these
disproportionately
benefit

why
have

a

i
worry
about

slow
rise
in

for

and
the

what
will
you
do
regarding
the
amount
of
state
public
dollars
going
into
private

and
busing
to
private
schools
using
public
funds
i
m
thinking
about
all
over
the
state
lakewood
jackson
toms
river
specifically
a
significant
amount
of
state
funding
has
been
siphoned
from
these
school
districts
into
private
schools
to
the
detriment
of
lakewoods
budgets
and
this
has
been
going
on
for
decades
what
can
we
do
to
resolve
these
issues
so
that
everyone
in
the
state
has
access
to
the
best
free
public
education
i
worry
too
about
property
taxes
cost
of
housing
i
grew
up
in
long
branch
nj
i
cannot
afford
to
rent
a
1

it
difficult
for
nj
residents
to
arrive
to
work
on

or
be

to

somebody
needs
to
put
some
thought
into
the
differences
between
ease
of
access
transportation
employment
opportunities
living
conditions
and
cost
of
living
across
the
state
a
major
portion
of
southern
new
jersey
outside
of
shore
towns
is
bordering
destitute
and
majorly
depressed
the
average
home
price
in
salem
county
is
a
third
of
the
average
cost
of
housing
in
cape
may
and
yet
they
share
relative
property
tax
averages
and
this
is
a
common
theme
across
the
state
salem
and
cumberland
county
held
some
of
the
highest
suicide
rates
in
the
state
as
of
the
last
few
years
and
mental
health
overall
is
declining
rapidly
and
our
government
seems
to
be
only
concerned
with
life
in
the
northwestern
corner
cumberland
county
is
historically
the
most
impoverished
county
in
the
state
and
it
s
only
getting
worse
i
know
more
adult
people
living
off
credit
cards
and
filing
for
bankruptcy
because
of
student
loans
and
high
cost
of
living
than
i
ever
thought
possible
we
have
no
trains
no
convenient
public
transportation
why
does
nobody
seem
to
care
about
this
and
why
when
there
is
so
little
opportunity
do
these
counties
pay
almost
just
as
much
in
property
taxes
as
anywhere
else
the
average
income
in
cumberland
is
around
60k
household
that
s
30k
average
by
person
the
lowest
in
the
state
what
are
your
views
on
this
will
you
continue
to
ignore
a
major

of
your
citizens

the

cities
in
nj
were
to
grow
at
a
similarly
rapid
rate
that
jersey
city
has
grown
how
do
you
think
that
politicians
in
nj
would
respond
regarding
transportation
infrastructure
in
those
areas
in
your
opinion
if
other
nj
areas
start
seeing
rapid
growth
would
nj
political
leaders
be
more
likely
to
support
more
road
infrastructure
or
more
public
transit
infrastructure
trains
buses
path
etc
in
those
fast
growing
areas
is
there
a
threshold
of
population
density
like
people
per
square
mile
that
if
the
threshold
were
crossed
that
nj
political
leaders
would
favor
public
transit
infrastructure
more
so
than
road
personal
vehicle
infrastructure
what
are
some
of
your
positions
regarding
property
tax
increases
and
how
to
either
bring
them
down
or
at
the
very
least
hault
any
possible
increases
until
they
can
be
properly
fixed
for
instance
i
m
in
green
brook
last
year
my
taxes
jumped
about
1
000
year
and
this
year
they
jumped
almost
3k
we
re
now
just
over
16k
year
no
home
or
property
improvements
and
conversely
have
had
problems
with
many
ash
trees
on
our
property
now
requiring
me
to
spend
about
30k
for
all
tree
removal
so
they
don
t
land
on
my
house
or
surrounding
homes
one
tree
landed
on
my
woodshop
shed
and
it
took
10
months
to
get
it
resolved
with
insurance
which
brings
me
to
my
last
question
if
we
are
introduced
to
another
invasive
insect
such
as
the
ash
borer
beetle
which
decimated
our
ash
trees
how
proactive
would
your
administration
be
in
making
sure
they
don
t
spread
thanks
for
your
time
many
things
about
our
society
government
functions
need
fixing
but
none
of
it
matters
if
we
continue
to
damage
our
planet
leading
to
a
reduction
of
resources
and
inevitable
catastrophic
consequences
what
are
some
environmental
policies
you
plan
to
implement
would
you
rather
fight
1000
duck
sized
horses
or
1
horse
sized
duck
myself
and
my
peers
age
25
32
all
make
a
decent
living
but
most
of
us
are
locked
out
of
the
housing
market
in
nj
partly
due
to
citadel
blackrock
etc
borrowing
at
fed
fund
rates
to
buy
up
residential
real
estate
and
rent
the
properties
if
governor
do
you
have
any
plan
or
want
to
combat
this
i
know
many
people
whose
families
have
been
in
nj
for
generations
and
have
to
move
due
to
unaffordable
housing
housing
here
is
always
expensive
relative
to
the
rest
of
the
country
but
this
is
different
this
is
taking
the
power
away
from
individuals
to
build
their
own
wealth
through
home
ownership
and
is
the
biggest
issue
amongst
my
peers
hi
i
lived
in
jersey
city
for
several
years
while
you
were
mayor
all
in
all
i
think
you
were
a
responsible
mayor
what
are
your
thoughts
on
funding
government
with
other
methods
besides
taxes
such
as
renting
public
land
or
sovereign
wealth
funds
do
you
have
any
plans
regarding
development
in
newark
specifically
are
you
in
favor
of
a
jersey
city
like
trajectory
or
something
else
if
we
need
more
warehouses
should
we
build
them
on
land
that
has
already
been
developed
such
as
suburban
office
parks
should
we
aggressively
try
to
save
whatever
is
left
of
our
farmland
pork
roll
or
taylor
ham
does
central
jersey
exist
you
ve
been
vocal
against
tax
abatements
for
businesses
and
real
estate
developments
in
the
state
without
these
types
of
programs
how
will
nj
compete
with
similar
tax
abatement
programs
in
neighboring
states
how
will
nj
incentivize
businesses
to
locate
in
a
state
as
expensive
and
tough
to
do
business
in
as
nj
would
you
dismantle
the
film
tax
credit
program
that
was
critical
in
getting
the
netflix
studios
in
nj
what
is
your
favorite
thing
about
working
with
the
legend
that
is
rich
boggiano
for
me
it
would
probably
a
toss
up
between
his
dashing
good
looks
and
his
cantankerous
statler
and
waldorf
like
opinions
on
just
about
everything
or
the
fiery
passion
for
the
city
he
raised
his
family
in
and
loves
so
much
i
d
probably
go
looks
though
why
aren
t
you
addressing
the
worsening
quality
of
life
issues
in
jersey
city
e
bikes
dangerously
riding
on
sidewalks
zero
traffic
enforcement
overflowing
garbage
cans
out
of
control
boe
dysfunctional
911
system
increase
in
crime
just
to
name
a
few
all
while
you
raised
taxes
on
the
middle
class
drove
out
lifelong
residents
by
making
the
city
unaffordable
while
giving
tax
breaks
to
millionaire
developers
how
come
you
don
t
give
your
own
residents
an
opportunity
to
publicly
ask
you
questions
on
the
subject
of
njtransit
would
you
be
willing
to
increase
the
revenue
transfer
from
the
turnpike
authoirty
njtransit
to
cover
operations
additionally
what
capital
expenditures
would
you
make
to
invest
in
growing
rail
and
bus
service
what
do
you
consider
to
be
low
hanging
fruit
please
explain
why
you
re
continuing
to
campaign
despite
polling
in
the
single
digits
why
do
you
think
anyone
would
want
a
puppet
propped
up
by
a
handful
of
wealthy
real
estate
developers
to
run
the
state
you
didn
t
say
a
word
about
amy
degise
that
doesn
t
surprise
anyone
but
do
you
not
see
that
your
actions
speak
volumes
about
your
willingness
to
play
ball
with
the
bosses
but
please
take
the
opportunity
to
explain
that
you
started
an
international
incident
with
the
polish
government
as
the
mayor
why
would
anyone
want
a
guy
who
picks
ridiculous
fights
for
his
developer
buddies
to
run
something
as
large
and
complicated
as
the
state
of
nj
what
is
your
plan
for
transparency
with
your
wife
s
business
dealings
your
attempt
to
help
her
buy
a
space
to
rent
to
a
dispensary
was
an
embarrassment
to
yourself
and
to
the
people
of
jersey
city
bertoli
peddled
access
to
your
office
but
that
had
nothing
to
do
with
you
silverman
was
able
to
force
their
real
estate
projects
into
a
public
art
program
with
a
single
phone
call
to
your
office
how
has
any
of
that
changed
how
do
feel
that
the
gubernatorial
race
is
likely
going
to
competitive
based
on
the
results
of
the
presidential
election
what
are
you
going
to
do
for
folks
that
either
moved
away
from
the
democratic
party
or
folks
who
didn
t
bother
to
show
up
to
the
polls
what
2
steps
will
you
take
on
day
one
to
fix
nj
transit
how
are
you
going
to
fix
the
path
and
nj
transit
are
you
going
to
allow
njtransit
to
operate
path
do
you
envision
your
transit
oriented
development
plan
clashing
with
any
local
nimby
opposition
regarding
dense
housing
around
transit
locations
some
townships
residents
might
not
be
as
eager
to
build
apartment
buildings
to
provide
those
opportunities
near
their
stations
which
would
hamper
access
to
the
transportation
if
those
buildings
were
either
pushed
out
of
town
centers
denied
entirely
will
lift
the
ban
on
casinos
building
elsewhere
in
new
jersey
not
just
restricted
to
atlantic
city
if
applied
would
you
allow
for
legal
poker
rooms
throughout
the
state
of
new
jersey
if
you
will
not
allow
legal
poker
rooms
throughout
the
state
will
you
at
least
look
into
the
algorithm
of
fair
online
poker
and
provide
the
results
what
s
up
with
the
drones
how
will
you
support
state
agencies
in
meeting
our
clean
energy
goals
as
a
21
year
old
i
am
scared
that
i
will
not
be
able
to
buy
a
home
in
the
state
i
love
in
the
near
future
do
you
have
any
plans
to
help
out
potential
first
time
home
buyers
and
or
control
the
housing
market
what
are
your
thoughts
on
non
market
housing
and
would
you
consider
investing
in
the
transit
village
initiative
also
how
would
you
support
the
creation
of
bus
rapid
transit
system
for
the
world
cup
in
2026
and
the
extension
of
the
hudson
bergen
light
rail
what
s
with
these
drones
i
was
attacked
by
the
paterson
police
in
2019
was
never
charged
with
any
crime
but
illegally
had
my
guns
seized
by
the
state
of
nj
i
was
forced
out
of
the
state
through
an
illegal
arrest
warrant
for
failure
to
appear
at
trial
when
i
was
never
charged
in
october
of
this
year
i
was
prevented
from
attending
my
mother
s
funeral
because
of
this
illegal
warrant
this
was
retaliation
for
exposing
public
corruption
in
paterson
in
the
course
of
my
practice
as
an
attorney
what
will
you
do
to
help
me
and
ensure
that
these
abuses
of
office
lawfare
and
political
retaliations
will
stop
what
is
your
position
on
medical
marijuana
pricing
and
would
you
allow
homegrow
for
patients
you
take
pride
in
your
record
on
vision
zero
and
road
safety
could
you
explain
why
then
after
three
terms
under
your
leadership
jersey
city
has
a
reputation
for
dangerous
drivers
who
flout
the
law
here
and
why
enforcement
remains
so
poor
despite
jc
having
one
of
the
highest
per
capita
police
in
the
country
furthermore
why
did
you
run
with
an
obstructionist
like
boggiano
on
your
slate
who
is
so
opposed
to
all
traffic
calming
efforts
by
the
community
and
opposes
recommendations
by
your
own
staff
why
should
we
believe
you
ll
bring
any
meaningful
change
when
streets
outside
of
downtown
jc
remain
so
dangerous
in
light
of
nj
democrats
lackluster
performance
in
the
2024
presidential
election
including
in
stronghold
counties
such
as
your
home
turf
hudson
county
what
are
your
top
priorities
for
restoring
voters
trust
in
the
party
and
in
government
as
a
force
for
good
more
generally
rep
vandrew
just
made
a
statement
on
fox
news
that
the
drones
should
be
shot
out
of
the
air
while
framing
the
drones
as
being
from
iran
1
the
last
time
a
nj
politician
called
for
civilians
to
take
things
into
their
own
hands
we
ended
up
with
jan
6
how
would
you
compel
the
house
to
censure
vandrew
and
keep
new
jersey
out
of
an
international
crisis
initiated
through
badly
informed
domestic
terrorism
as
governor
how
would
you
compel
the
dod
to
be
more
transparent
in
their
actions
over
civilian
airspace
note
i
would
really
like
to
see
answers
around
public
transit
and
maintaining
our

it
s
just

he
closes
the
broadcast
more
clearly
stating
he
believes
they
are
from
iran
and
recklessly
states
at
the
beginning
of
the
broadcast
that
his
secret
sources
say
they
are
from
iran
what
is
the
plan
to
make
nj
transit
affordable
i
commute
to
trenton
and
work
for
the
state
the
15
fare
increase
and
termination
of
the
flex
pass
has
made
taking
the
train
to
work
too
expensive
to
justify
now
i
am
one
of
the
many
cars
sitting
in
traffic
on
route
1
everyday
shouldn
t
we
incentive
taking
public
transportation
and
make
it
affordable
i
m
a
young
guy
in
his
30s
stuck
living
with
relatives
working
a
retail
minimum
wage
job
in
south
jersey
college
isnt
really
an
option
due
to
massive
student
loans
and
credit
card
debt
appartment
rents
are
out
of
control
and
nj
transit
is
seriously
neglected
in
this
area
that
there
job
opportunities
are
extremely
limited
as
governor
what
can
you
do
to
address
the
lack
of
opportunity
for
people
like
me
as
you
have
intimate
experience
with
the
path
system
realistically
what
can
you
do
to
turn
the
path
into
a
an
actual
real
world
class
working
transit
system
on
par
if
not
better
than
how
the
mta
is
run
specifically
late
night
and
weekend
regular
service
with
decent
schedules
instead
of
the
terrible
schedule
it
is
now
and
of
course
please
get
rid
of
the
weekend
hoboken
stopover
for
the
33
jsq
line
will
you
commit
to
better
transparency
around
crime
data
and
expanding
and
improving
programs
such
as
the
ag
s
arrive
together
that
would
help
reallocate
funding
for
police
back
to
the
community
will
you
personally
shoot
down
the
drones
how
do
you
justify
touting
abolishing
the
county
line
system
when
you
were
openly
supporting
tammy
murphy
for
the
senate
primary
as
mayor
you
made
a
comment
that
you
think
teachers
are
paid
too
much
if
you
truly
believe
that
what
can
public
school
teachers
expect
from
you
if
you
were
to
become
governor
what
will
you
do
to
make
new
jersey
s
school
aide
formula
fairer
for
suburban
and
rural
municipalities
what
s
going
on
with
the
drones
new
jersey
has
long
been
a
democratic
stronghold
there
appears
to
be
a
shift
in
the
electorate
voters
want
change
why
do
you
think
it
s
important
that
a
democrat
remains
in
the
governor
s
office
what
have
you
learned
from
the
2024
election
that
will
help
you
win
the
gubernatorial
race
what
is
your
position
on
reinstating
the
usage
of
traffic
safety
cameras
especially
red
light
and
stop
sign
cameras
that
are
proven
to
reduce
dangerous
behavior
and
save
lives
will
you
stand
up
to
the
obvious
self
interested
lie
that
cameras
are
somehow
an
invasion
of
privacy
can
we
become
like
wisconsin
and
get
rid
of
state
tolls
can
you
get
public
transportation
up
and
running
so
we
re
not
embarrassed
at
the
world
cup
finals
busses
on
major
roads
that
automatically
turn
the
light
green
so
taking
bus
is
faster
than
taking
a
car
trolly
lines
bike
lanes
more
one
way
streets
in
populated
areas
no
parking
within
10
feet
of
a
curb
can
we
get
high
speed
rails
newark
to
philly
what
s
going
on
with
bayfront
redevelopment
project
in
jersey
city
nothing
material
has
happened
in
over
a
year
i
live
in
the
area
and
a
year
ago
it
seemed
they
were
amending
the
infrastructure
with
the
constant
heavy
machinery
but
there
s
nothing
else
going
on
this
seemed
like
a
massive
opportunity
but
there
s
no
timeline
out
there
and
it
seems
frankly
that
it
s
just
going
to
fall
to
the
wayside
and
not
go
anywhere
at
this
point
is
there
any
prospective
date
for
phase
1
completion
up
until
senator
kim
successfully
sued
the
county
clerks
new
jersey
s
primary
ballots
were
wholly
unfair
giving
county
party
approved
candidates
preferential
treatment
on
the
ballot
while
outsiders
were
placed
in
ballot
siberia
in
addition
to
the
fact
that
the
process
for
county
party
approval
varies
by
county
from
no
process
to
open
convention
many
of
these
county
party
leaders
on
both
sides
are
lobbyists
and
or
hold
millions
of
dollars
in
contracts
with
municipal
county
and
state
governments
this
format
was
deemed
unconstitutional
by
the
court
and
new
jersey
had
its
first
fair
ballot
election
in
june
2024
rather
than
allow
this
sort
of
fairness
we
saw
six
months
ago
as
we
speak
the
legislature
is
moving
to
restructure
the
ballot
in
an
attempt
to
gain
whatever
competitive
edge
they
can
before
they
themselves
run
next
june
this
comes
in
the
form
of
brackets
for
candidates
and
indicators
on
the
ballot
for
incumbents
both
of
which
are
unabashedly
disgraceful
where
do
you
stand
on
these
matters
should
party
leaders
be
allowed
to
be
employed
by
lobbying
firms
should
lawmakers
that
support
these
bad
actors
while
changing
to
the
ballot
to
suit
themselves
pay
a
political
price
for
doing
so
are
there
plans
to
expand
the
once
a
week
street
cleaning
that
was
implemented
for
downtown
to
other
neighbors
of
jc
and
why
aren
t
we
holding
pseg
veolia
responsible
for
their
extremely
subpar
road
repair
they
still
leave
perfectly
good
streets
practically
undrivable
when
they
re
finished
can
you
describe
the
root
cause
of
the
recent
surge
of
updog
in
jersey
city
hi
mr
mayor

if
you
are
elected
governor
would
you
consider
a
congestion
pricing
plan
in
place
on
new
yorker
s
coming
into
nj
as
a
resident
of
jersey
city
seeing
so
many
ny
license
plates
on
our
residential
streets
and
parked
in
driveways
right
on
montgomery
just
look
at
the
fleets
of
yellow
cabs
and
black
car
services
consider
also
the
number
of
visitors
on
our
parkways
during
the
summer
i
m
all
for
the
tourism
but
it

we

some
of
these

what
sort
of
ideas
do
you
have
for
bringing
additional
industries
to
the
state
to
reduce
our
reliance
on
pharmaceutical
companies
rah
what
are
your
plans
for
dealing
with
the
next
four
years
of
a
trump
presidency
how
will
you
protect
nj
from
attacks
on
education
healthcare
women
s
rights
etc
can
new
york
take
hudson
county
and
trade
it
to
nj
for
staten
island
do
you
have
any
plans
to
improve
connection
between
nj
nyc
i
e
the
failed
tunnel
project
of
years
past
what
are
your
thoughts
on
a
public
private
sector
partnership
for
nj
transit
and
it
s
need
to
expand
and
add
service
to
existing
areas
it
s
worked
well
in
other
countries
how
do
you
plan
to
protect
trans
rights
which
will
be
under
assault
from
trump
as
a
monmouth
county
resident
i
d
like
to
know
what
you
could
do
to
end
the
annual
property
reassements
that
are
driving
assessed
property
values
through
the
roof
and
contributing
to
skyrocketing
property
taxes
how
will
you
maintain
the
quality
of
our
education
system
and
fortify
it
against
a
presidential
administration
that
is
anticipated
to
be
hostile
toward
public
education
how
will
you
protect
and
retain
our
educators
counselors
and
other
school
support
staff
and
how
will
you
protect
students
what
is
your
plan
to
encourage
more
transit
oriented
development
specifically
in
towns
that
have
train
lines
what
can
the
state
government
do
to
push
reluctant
towns
towards
allowing
more
types
of
multi
family
also
how
do
you
think
about
the
fact
that
inclusionary
zoning
is
raising
the
rents
of
new
units
while
leaving
incumbent
homeowners
off
the
hook
for
affordable
housing
will
you
continue
to
fund
teachers
pension
like
murphy
has
why
should
anyone
trust
dems
to
engage
nj
voters
state
is
turning
red
and
yall
seem
more
out
of
touch
every
year
putting
policy
disagreements
to
the
side
for
a
moment
who
are
2
3
new
jersey
republicans
you
respect
across
the
aisle
dear
mr
fulop
thank
you
for
appearing
here
and
answering
questions
your
website
is
very
informative
and
i
agree
with
many
of
your
educational
points
however
i
am
extremely
concerned
about
your
ideas
bussing
students
to
new
school
districts
the
idea
of
having
a
child
on
a
bus
for
hours
daily
is
not
one
i
can
support
i
would
understand
consolidating
a
district
with
only
an
elementary
or
elementary
middle
school
into
the
district
where
it
sends
their
students
to
high
school
however
i
cannot
agree
with
making
county
wide
school
districts
where
students
would
be
bussed
for
hours
daily
in
my
own
town
getting
to
the
high
school
takes
15
minutes
with
no
traffic
but
if
287
backs
up
onto
local
roads
then
kids
are
on
the
bus
for
an
hour
if
you
have
more
students
on
busses
for
longer
distances
daily
you
are
increasing
the
risk
of
bus
accidents
injuries
and
death
this
would
end
up
precluding
students
from
after
school
elective
activities
and
sports
it
would
create
an
undue
burden
on
families
driving
and
needing
to
pick
students
up
from
far
away
i
understand
that
where
you
are
a
mayor
schools
are
close
together
and
it
is
less
burdensome
to
walk
a
few
additional
blocks
but
if
you
want
to
be
governor
you
need
to
account
for
the
entire
state
your
plan
is
extremely
shortsighted
for
suburban
and
rural
areas
i
truly
hope
you
reconsider
your
school
re
zoning
plans
i
do
not
know
if
you
have
ever
had
an
hour
or
two
hour
daily
commute
i
have
it
is
soul
sucking
and
there
are
studies
that
prove
long
daily
commutes
increase
stress
and
decrease
quality
of
life
and
hasten
death
i
know
you
want
students
to
do
better
on
standardized
testing
i
truly
think
all
kids
deserve
quality
education
but
this
plan
is
not
a
good
way
to
help
kids
you
are
only
doing
harm
with
this
plan
can
your
office
look
into
nj
e
zpass
regarding
their
obnoxious
administration
fee
when
one
passes
a
toll
without
an
e
zpass
account
where
is
that
money
going
and
why
does
the
nj
e
zpass
office
in
newark
have
such
horrific
reviews
most
of
your
first
responders
because
they
live
outside
the
city
cannot
help
elect
a
mayor
but
electing
a
governor
is
definitely
something
they
can
vote
for
how
do
you
plan
on
leveraging
that
community
so
ensure
they
do
vote
for
you
what
is
your
plan
for
curbing
the
influx
of
immigrants
from
staten
island
and
how
can
all
the
current
ones
be
returned
do
you
ever
say
fulop
regular
unleaded
whenever
you
get
gas
at
any
of
our
fine
new
jersey
gas
stations
what
are
your
plans
if
any
to
support
the
arts
and
continue
to
have
it
thrive
in
the
state
do
you
understand
the
ipcc
reports
on
climate
change
specifically
the
consequences
and
timelines
of
exceeding
2c
have
you
thought
about
how
you
could
explain
it
to
your
children
when
they
re
older
in
an
era
of
identity
politics
i
d
love
to
get
to
a
place
where
we
can
see
all
of
our
neighbors
as
humans
and
not
just
bearers
of
political
lawn
signs
do
you
have
any
ideas
on
how
to
unite
with
republicans
and
other
parties
to
accomplish
goals
thank
you
for
your
service
what
are
your
thoughts
on
homeowners
moving
out
of
their
family
home
to
move
elsewhere
but
not
sell
the
house
and
instead
turn
it
into
a
rental
property
and
then
the
renters
are
unrelated
people
who
then
rent
to
their
friends
and
then
all
of
sudden
what
is
coded
as
a
single
family
home
becomes
this
business
rental
property
with
mattresses
all
over
the
rooms
with
20
unrelated
people
in
the
home
who
pretend
to
be
cousins
and
crowd
the
street
with
all
their
all
cars
and
commercial
vehicles
commercial
vehicles
that
should
not
be
parked
in
a
residential
neighborhood
mind
you
and
then
more
homeowners
in
your
neighborhood
do
this
practice
and
then
what
once
was
a
residential
neighborhood
for
single
family
homes
becomes
this
rental
business
and
then
people
wonder
why
jersey
is
turning
trashy
why
is
the
single
family
neighborhood
not
respected
why
are
so
many
unrelated
people
allowed
to
live
in
these
homes
like
this
why
do
we
allow
our
neighborhood
houses
to
become
landlord
tenant
this
isn
t
an
apartment
complex
this
isn
t
commercial
real
estate
either
buy
a
house
and
live
it
or
don
t
buy
a
house
stop
turning
a
home
into
an
apartment
people
turning
their
home
into
rental
properties
then
in
turn
are
raising
the
housing
market
since
now
everyone
wants
to
buy
a
home
cheaply
renovate
it
a
little
and
then
immediately
move
in
tenants
and
the
owners
themselves
were
never
actually
planning
on
living
it
these
neighborhoods
are
meant
to
be
for
owners
not
renters
someone
needs
to
fix
this
please
how
s
the
weather
in
narragansett
gunshots
or
fireworks
thiiiiiiiis
all
of
this
a
limited
intrastate
mass
transit
system
is
detrimental
to
new
jerseyans
yes
this
the
only
way
i
can
get
from
north
bergen
county
to
hoboken
or
jc
is
going
through
nyc
as
somebody
who
works
with
the
blind
this
is
so
needed
especially
in
northwest
jersey
yes
i
commute
from
the
shore
to
trenton
there
is
absolutely
no
other
option
other
than
driving
everyday
car
enthusiasts
hate
on
public
transit
and
fail
to
realize
that
more
transit
less
traffic
for
those
that
opt
to
drive
how
are
they
not
the
loudest
proponents
for
trains
see
i
e
the
train
lines
that
used
to
run
out
of
liberty
state
park
in
jersey
city
where
you
are
currently
mayor
and
all
over
the
state
including
down
the
coast
how
can
we
get
train
lines
up
and
running
in
a
similar
fashion
again
the
stops
are
still
listed
on
the
boards
there
and
reading
them
and
walking
by
is
infuriating
how
jealous
i
am
of
the
transit
system
that
once
was
some
even
had
meal
service
on
board
safe
biking
options
would
be
great
there
s
a
ton
of
stuff
within
a
five
mile
radius
of
me
but
trying
to
bike
there
is
always
frustrating
and
often
dangerous
i
don
t
know
you
but
it
feels
really
nice
to
know
someone
else
in
this
state
feels
the
same
way
i
do
hope
you
have
a
great
day
divert
some
of
that
10b
for
additional
turnpike
lanes
yes
plz
i
second
this
question
i
support
single
payer
but
this
is
a
loser
at
the
state
level
this
something
for
the
federal
government
what
steps
could
be
taken
to
move
us
toward
a
public
option
chris
christie
actually
covered
this
pretty
well
by
saying
that
it
s
something
that
he
supports
the
idea
of
but
can
t
make
happen
from
the
governor
s
office
you
can
t
forcibly
merge
towns
they
have
to
agree
to
do
it
themselves
this
plus
any
thoughts
on
how
you
would
do
something
like
that
for
schools
considering
how
powerful
the
teachers
unions
are
in
nj
agreed
towns
have
to
agree
on
it
sussex
and
wantage
explored
the
idea
but
the
referendum
failed
primarily
because
wantage
s
taxes
would
be
raised
while
sussex
borough
s
would
be
lowered
i
suspect
this
is
the
major
reason
why
you
don
t
see
more
of
this
i
mean
murphy
tried
a
lot
here
i
d
like
to
see
if
fulop
has
a
different
strategy
i
really
would
like
a
detailed
reply
to
this
corporations
should
not
be
allowed
to
own
family
homes
land
value
tax
or
a
split
tax
to
replace
property
taxes
and
freedom
zoning
would
basically
solve
everything
but
i
doubt
any
governor
candidate
would
have
the
power
or
will
to
do
either
even
more
unpopular
would
be
to
limit
rent
controlled
housing
and
end
old
people
property
taxes
rebates
i
don
t
think
we
should
do
either
of
those
but
that
would
fix
housing
as
well
i
just
want
to
take
transit
to
work
but
there
s
no
usable
transit
for
most
of
the
state
and
what
is
there
is
unreliable
there
s
no
jobs
available
where
there
s
transit
and
no
transit
where
there
s
jobs
and
maybe
get
a
seat
on
the
bus
too
while
we
re
at
it
i
second
this
question
this
or
if
it
s
not
possible
to
mandate
find
incentives
boroughitis
is
not
good
https
en
wikipedia
org
wiki
boroughitis
nj
has
one
of
the
highest
malpractice
insurances
it
s
why
a
lot
of
drs
don
t
practice
and
if
they
do
they
charge
a
lot
of
curious
to
see
what
he
has
to
say
about
this
drones
seconding
this
because
nj
hasn
t
had
a
party
stay
in
power
for
3
terms
in
decades
that
would
require
updates
to
the
mlul
he
is
pro
pro
development
and
pro
mount
laurel
i
don
t
think
he
wants
to
stop
developers
at
all
nj
employers
certainly
want
to
have
employees
earning
minimum
wage
this
right
here
he
kissed
their
asses
until
they
snubbed
him
but
don
t
be
fooled
the
apple
doesn
t
fall
far
from
the
tree
and
rental
only
at
that
not
even
many
condos
going
up
allowing
people
to
own
the
community
stability
that
comes
with
that
seconded
on
the
private
vs
public
schooling
it
sounds
like
this
administration
wants
to
move
closer
to
more
funds
for
private
schools
and
less
for
public
he
won
t
even
direct
and
fund
a
jcpd
traffic
enforcement
division
to
make
jc
streets
safer
all
talk
no
results
can
we
get
literally
any
regulations
on
public
marijuana
use
i
m
severely
allergic
and
i
ve
had
asthma
attacks
from
driving
or
walking
through
clouds
of
marijuana
smoke
also
many
people
smoke
cigarettes
and
or
marijuana
at
bus
stops
and
i
have
seen
and
suffered
from
people
vaping
on
nj
transit
buses
given
your
flair
does
that
mean
boroughs
get
to
remain
independent
central
jersey
exists
is
this
jim
mcgreevey
s
burner
account
i
just
wanna
go
down
the
shore
without
being
stuck
in
traffic
all
day
and
without
going
all
the
way
up
to
secaucus
not
to
mention
everyone
would
love
less
cars
on
our
highways
maybe
the
drones
we
re
seeing
can
be
turned
into
public
transit
my
2
5hr
transit
with
multiple
transfers
to
actual
workplaces
in
nj
kills
me
when
they
re
just
20min
drives
i
dont
drive
we
need
more
funding
for
njtransit
to
run
better
we
don
t
need
more
electric
cars
and
gas
guzzlers
it
s
causing
havoc
i
ve
love
a
loop
for
north
and
south
jersey
so
you
could
go
between
the
lines
when
you
need
to
i
d
settle
for
a
more
complete
bus
system
don
t
the
rail
lines
up
there
terminate
in
hoboken
defnitely
feel
the
lack
of
options
though
jersey
city
can
t
even
get
a
bike
line
on
a
road
just
a
few
blocks
from
the
mayor
s
house
https
www
google
com
amp
s
hudsoncountyview
com
advocates
urge
jersey
city
to
make
heights
bike
lane
permanent
before
grant
expires
amp
just
one
more
lane
doc
that
ll
fix
it
i
can
understand
replacing
the
existing
bridge
with
a
marginally
larger
one
i
do
not
comprehend
basically
doubling
bridge
capacity
for
cars
if
we
re
building
2
bridges
over
there
one
of
them
should
be
linking
the
hblr
to
the
newark
light
rail
with
a
follow
up
if
the
answer
is
no
why
not
as
we
ve
seen
that
s
not
happening
any
time
soon
massachusetts
passed
single
payer
health
care
at
the
state
level
why
can
t
nj
i
think
federal
is
too
big
maybe
regional
is
the
way
to
go
could
nj
form
a
coalition
with
like
minded
states
don
t
disagree
with
this
perspective
would
definitely
prefer
national
single
payer
we
already
have
the
nj
family
care
nj
united
let
s
keep
moving
if
there
s
a
will
there
s
a
way
christie
had
some
decent
ideas
but
was
just
a
lazy
fat
mess
who
became
drunk
on
his
own
power
i
actually
work
in
govt
perhaps
the
state
could
offer
some
kind
of
incentive
our
school
district
just
merged
and
everyone
was
for
it
you
wouldn
t
be
cutting
teachers
you
d
be
cutting
admin
if
anything
just
take
the
reduced
admin
costs
to
cover
increases
for
the
lower
earning
teachers
to
make
them
commensurate
with
the
higher
earning
district
during
the
merge
unless
we
tax
the
value
of
the
land
or
a
split
tax
property
taxes
are
a
scam
easiest
way
to
bring
housing
costs
down
is
to
build
more
houses
out
the
wazoo
ones
that
are
sold
to
people
instead
of
airbnb
make
supply
meet
or
outpace
demand
i
think
it
s
either
dfw
or
houston
that
tackled
this
problem
in
recent
years
above
his
pay
grade
at
the
moment
someone
just
do
something
i
m
not
talking
nimby
stuff
like
opposing
housing
some
do
but
it
s
unacceptable
when
developers
literally
taunt
residents
at
meetings
who
are
upset
that
an
amazon
warehouse
is
being
constructed
less
than
300
feet
from
their
door
hey
if
the
solution
is
paying
everyone
35
an
hour
minimum
i
ll
support
it
but
you
can
t
have
a
minimum
wage
of
15
and
median
home
prices
at
510k
in
the
same
state
the
math
ain
t
mathin
merge
the
boroughs
too
actually
there
are
currently
us
companies
creating
drone
taxies
that
will
work
from
airports
around
nyc
would
be
great
if
nj
would
be
an
early
adaptor
and
set
up
the
infrastructure
for
them
and
reduce
red
tape
it
s
also
way
easier
faster
environmentally
friendlier
and
cheaper
than
rail
to
set
up
even
if
you
take
the
train
to
the
shore
today
you
still
have
to
carry
all
your
bags
chairs
coolers
kids
etc
onto
the
train
and
then
once
you
get
to
the
shore
it
s
not
exactly
a
short
walk
from
the
train
station
to
the
beach
while
you
are
transporting
all
this
stuff
i
don
t
see
that
as
being
any
more
convenient
than
being
stuck
in
traffic
which
is
why
everyone
drives
optimistic
answer
nothing
but
political
will
pessimistic
the
fact
that
1
6th
of
the
state
economy
is
biomed
is
that
true
if
we
re
i
think
i
would
have
heard
of
it
because
that
would
a
major
political
accomplishment
that
s
been
my
thought
for
a
while
get
all
the
ne
states
and
to
group
together
and
offer
a
single
payer
option
to
compete
with
for
profit
insurance
having
tens
of
million
people
or
so
to
bargain
with
hmos
would
be
a
huge
advantage
compared
to
a
few
million
also
we
the
federal
government
already
cover
people
over
65
which
are
by
far
the
most
expensive
group
of
people
with
medicare
and
medicaid
covers
another
18
9
of
people
not
to
mention
6
of
the
10
healthiest
states
are
in
the
north
east
so
our
costs
per
person
should
be
less
than
states
with
much
higher
rates
of
things
like
obesity
what
can
the
governor
do
to
nudge
that
along
say
we
as
a
state
demanded
that
south
hackensack
and
hackensack
regular
merge
how
would
you
make
that
happen
if
they
weren
t
on
board
with
tht
idea
let
s
not
even
say
resistant
to
it
just
that
it
isn
t
on
their
mind
you
gotta
change
the
flair
to
merge
the
municipalities
then
speak
for
yourself
one
bag
is
all
i
have
ever
brought
whenever
i
have
gone
anywhere
down
the
shore
ah
i
was
wrong
it
was
a
non
binding
ballot
initiative
that
passed
offer
to
increase
state
aid
if
they
merge
my
point
is
that
is
not
common
especially
for
people
with
families
sit
on
the
beach
and
look
around
chairs
umbrellas
canopies
coolers
are
everywhere
very
few
people
are
traveling
with
1
bag
imagine
bringing
all
that
stuff
on
the
train
with
you
that
is
why
everyone
drives
i
expect
housing
prices
to
hurt
ev
sales
younger
people
are
more
likely
to
adopt
newer
technology
like
evs
but
if
these
same
people
cannot
afford
a
house
they
are
not
going
to
spend
their
money
on
an
expensive
car
especially
one
that
requires
you
to
have
a
house
to
install
the
charger
in
i
have
an
ev
but
a
hybrid
or
any
car
that
does
35mpg
would
be
better
for
pricing
at
3
miles
per
kwh
and
0
21
kw
electric
price
my
car
costs
me
0
095
mile
with
the
250
registration
and
driving
10k
miles
a
year
i
actually
drive
5k
a
year
so
my
number
is
0
12
mile
the
math
was
250
miles
per
year
price
kwh
miles
per
kwh
and
i
have
myself
a
generous
3
miles
per
kwh
charging
at
fast
chargers
and
most
level
2
chargers
is
significantly
more
expensive
than
gas
evs
are
set
up
to
fail
as
it
stands
i
m
a
huge
fan
of
them
and
would
buykre
but
they
re
prohibitively
expensive
to
buy
and
the
cost
to
operate
them
is
only
masked
by
your
electric
bill
for
the
40
50k
that
an
affordable
ev
costs
you
can
get
an
elantra
hybrid
a
prius
a
camry
hybrid
and
much
more
i
have
an
ev
and
i
d
say
it
s
the
better
option
if
access
to
charging
is
convenient
there
s
nothing
better
than
waking
up
to
a
full
tank
every
day
there
s
also
the
other
benefit
of
being
able
to
smoke
any
vehicle
with
a
tailpipe
too
ridiculous
power
with
some
evs
they
d
make
more
progress
if
they
didn
t
de
incentivize
it
with
a
250
fee
removing
the
sales
tax
exemption
isn
t
going
to
help
ev
owners
were
in
shock
when
they
got
registration
renewal
notice
this
year
well
we
re
going
to
have
a
setback
for
the
next
four
years
my
wife
and
i
have
been
all
ev
since
late
2022
never
going
back
to
ice
for
a
daily
we
need
more
public
charging
places
with
rate
cheaper
than
supercharger
this
will
get
some
of
the
people
who
can
t
charge
at
home
to
buy
evs
i
d
love
an
ev
but
i
m
in
an
apartment
and
the
only
charging
station
near
me
is
a
dollar
general
also
it
seems
like
everything
to
do
with
evs
is
extra
expensive
i
previously
had
a
full
ev
had
to
sell
it
and
switch
to
a
phev
but
i
still
love
the
car
i
wonder
how
many
ev
s
will
it
take
on
the
roads
for
there
to
be
a
measurable
drop
in
air
pollution
levels
anyone
have
any
insight
has
it
happened
yet
we
could
have
built
so
much
rail
with
that
tax
credit
and
just
forced
people
to
not
buy
suvs
and
pickups
for
themselves
very
total
non
starter
unless
you
own
a
house
and
can
drop
a
charging
station
esp
if
you
are
not
in
the
dense
parts
of
the
state
where
charging
stations
exist
the
other
things
that
people
dont
talk
about
at
all
is
that
our
instrastructure
in
the
a
lot
of
the
state
would
have
a
big
problem
if
everyone
added
home
charging
stations
the
infrastructure
is
coming
remember
when
the
car
was
invented
they
didnt
have
paved
roads
and
they
made
due
demand
will
create
the
infrastructure
nj
is
a
smaller
dense
state
we
should
be
a
great
state
to
have
charging
stations
and
a
lot
of
ev
ownership
hopefully
they
can
bring
down
the
prices
and
increase
the
charging
infrastructure
more
charging
infrastructure
is
still
ass
around
me
the
newest
luxury
apartment
complex
only
has
4
ev
charging
ports
and
the
closest
public
charger
in
walmart
has
lines
that
remind
me
of
the
1970
s
energy
crisis
okay
i
m
exaggerating
but
those
lines
are
awful
my
apartment
complex
doesn
t
have
an
ev
charger
so
i
can
t
justify
getting
an
ev
at
this
point
even
though
i
m
definitely
open
to
it
their
first
goal
should
be
to
make
the
grid
handle
all
the
electric
cars
they
want
to
be
on
the
roads
electricity
prices
getting
jacked
up
so
high
is
what
will
kill
them
gas
prices
rise
but
also
can
fall
electric
is
just
going
to
keep
increasing
more
and
more
your
local
electric
provider
the
state
basically
will
have
a
monopoly
on
what
it
costs
you
to
drive
every
single
mile
i
say
this
as
someone
who
does
like
evs
pft
i
won
t
even
pay
the
250
with
an
incremental
increase
of
10
bucks
per
year
for
4
years
just
to
own
one
it
sounds
nice
in
theory
until
that
bill
comes
you
know
what
would
help
them
hit
the
goal
not
charge
250
for
each
registration
i
ll
never
get
an
electric
vehicle
love
the
comments
re
hybrids
evs
yes
currently
with
oil
subsidies
it
s
quite
cheap
but
if
you
own
a
home
and
get
tou
rates
it
comes
to
about
3
to
fill
up
my
taycan
80kw
gas
ain
t
that
cheap
and
that
s
sadly
why
homeowners
benefit
from
the
ev
tech
yeah
i
don
t
see
apartment
complexes
splurging
for
charging
stations
in
what
little
parking
they
can
offer
i
think
it
d
be
a
perk
but
i
don
t
see
it
scaling
without
significant
state
funding
yea
i
wish
i
could
get
an
electric
car
as
someone
who
commutes
to
a
lobster
with
plenty
of
chargers
but
i
dont
have
a
connection
where
i
rent
so
its
not
worth
it
that
s
anecdotal
but
i
think
its
a
common
theme
you
re
describing
thing
is
evs
are
much
cheaper
compared
to
regular
car
for
example
tesla
model
3
is
about
32k
with
0
finance
and
tax
refund
benefits
same
price
range
car
like
honda
accord
and
toyota
camry
will
have
regular
maintenance
and
gas
cost
this
is
one
of
the
reasons
people
are
buying
it
whenever
the
tax
incentives
will
go
away
people
won
t
really
buy
ev
s
because
it
doesn
t
make
sense
a
tesla
model
y
is
not
expensive
these
days
especially
with
the
incentives
but
even
without
those
incentives
tesla
has
lowered
the
price
a
lot
it
s
no
longer
a
70k
car
it
s
not
even
a
50k
car
in
many
cases
it
s
more
like
40k
and
people
are
shelling
out
for
high
priced
pickups
and
suvs
so
affordability
is
not
the
issue
i
do
see
charging
being
an
issue
especially
since
we
are
building
condos
and
high
density
housing
rather
than
single
family
homes
those
are
terrible
for
charging
public
charging
is
also
not
ideal
for
daily
driving
workplace
charging
can
work
but
more
people
are
wfh
now
so
even
that
gets
problematic
and
workplace
charging
often
isn
t
implemented
properly
it
s
free
on
many
places
and
doesn
t
require
people
to
move
once
their
allotted
time
is
up
or
their
car
is
charged
we
need
to
rethink
it
but
i
am
hopeful
we
will
solve
this
because
we
really
do
need
evs
to
fight
climate
change
it
is
a
very
powerful
tool
in
that
fight
i
did
the
math
based
on
the
gas
tax
vs
registration
fee
and
i
would
have
to
drive
my
maverick
25
000
miles
per
year
to
break
even
i
work
from
home
hybrid
all
the
way
i
grew
up
in
north
jersey
near
the
gwb
and
it
it
was
a
battle
20
years
ago
to
park
daily
in
front
of
your
own
house
i
couldn
t
imagine
how
it
is
now
considering
my
old
2
family
home
became
a
3
family
home
there
s
many
other
similarly
congested
communities
in
nnj
and
that
s
not
taking
into
account
apartment
buildings
in
these
older
neighborhoods
that
relied
on
street
parking
charging
infrastructure
should
be
top
priority
when
it
comes
to
allocating
funds
for
the
ev
programs
not
if
a
full
tank
only
gets
you
20
miles
or
so
this
they
paid
me
7k
to
buy
the
car
and
didn
t
charge
me
sales
tax
a
few
years
ago
now
they
re
forcing
me
to
pay
250
more
for
registration
equivalent
to
the
fuel
tax
a
gas
car
that
drives
20k
miles
in
a
year
would
pay
sure
that
s
logical
yea
they
should
just
do
a
fee
by
weight
that
s
irrespective
of
powertrain
trype
that
s
a
fair
argument
though
the
state
needs
to
figure
out
a
replacement
for
the
gas
tax
it
s
better
to
start
now
instead
of
being
caught
with
our
pants
down
in
like
5
years
when
they
have
to
renew
the
gas
tax
i
d
rather
have
them
already
thinking
about
it
instead
of
just
coming
up
with
ideas
when
presumably
ev
purchases
have
snowballed
to
put
a
significant
hit
into
gas
tax
revenue
tbh
it
s
all
really
difficult
no
matter
what
they
do
bs
everyone
should
pay
for
road
maintenance
given
the
implementation
1
000
fee
the
setback
is
due
to
the
the
car
prices
not
the
president
they
need
to
come
for
a
lot
out
of
curiousity
why
did
you
switch
was
it
a
tesla
or
another
make
good
comparison
was
the
lockdown
during
covid

you
think
people
who
are
buying
an
suv
pickup
for
grocery
getting
are
going
to
stop
because
we
build
more
rail
or
are
you
proposing
we
actually
force
them
to
stop
ah
yes
for
all
those
times
that
rail
directly
takes
me
to
work
the
grocery
store
to
family
and
friends
i
did
my
part
by
buying
a
little
prius
it
then
got
rear
ended
and
destroyed
by
a
pickup
for
sure
can
t
overlook
general
utility
and
manufacturing
monopolies
and
how
they
operate
shit
the
fact
how
an
electric
vehicle
is
an
extremely
old
concept
yet
comes
at
a
premium
near
luxury
is
no
accident
and
i
think
it
s
a
little
naive
for
people
to
assume
things
will
magically
transition
seamlessly
and
logically
especially
in
the
us
people
always
want
their
rub
same
can
be
said
for
how
public
transit
has
been
low
priority
and
basically
a
vague
political
football
to
kick
around
from
time
to
time
sure
sake
of
argument
there
s
always
the
proverbial
technicality
example
of
cheap
as
chips
range
anxiety
mobile
early
gen
nissan
leaf
as
an
ev
that
can
be
had
not
for
much
but
it
obviously
requires
a
particular
life
to
make
sense
of
it
even
in
a
dense
place
as
nj
obviously
people
are
rooting
for
them
and
i
m
not
a
hater
it
s
just
people
with
means
and
power
love
making
things
inconvenient
yup
exactly
the
amount
i
pay
per
kwh
is
up
50
in
4
years
if
i
did
the
math
on
an
electric
car
back
then
it
might
not
make
sense
today
nj
has
a
law
requiring
some
ev
parking
for
new
developments
my
experience
as
a
site
engineer
is
that
developers
will
almost
always
install
the
bare
minimum
required
by
the
law
at
this
point
they
don
t
see
it
as
being
profitable
for
themselves
also
we
get
a
lot
of
pushback
from
towns
with
volunteer
fire
departments
who
are
afraid
of
electric
cars
catching
on
fire
and
not
having
the
resources
to
control
a
fire
sometimes
as
a
condition
of
approval
we
will
be
limited
to
the
state
minimum
amount
of
ev
charging
many
charging
station
operators
do
the
install
for
free
or
there
are
great
tax
advantages
for
apartment
complexes
im
a
property
manager
there
are
many
tax
advantages
when
setting
up
ev
chargers
in
apartment
complexes
or
commercial
buildings
but
you
still
need
a
place
to
charge
the
vehicle
regardless
of
how
much
it
costs
to
purchase
that
is
the
biggest
limiting
factor
in
all
this
especially
since
we
are
building
condos
and
high
density
housing
these
areas
are
where
nj
should
lead
the
nation
in
creating
prioritized
bike
and
lower
speed
infrastructure
ebikes
and
e
scooters
and
regular
bikes
buses
trams
walking
fit
in
that
niche
where
cars
are
too
space
inefficient
car
sized
evs
are
fine
for
sprawly
suburbia
and
denser
parts
of
rural
areas
where
there
is
space
for
garages
and
offstreet
parking
as
a
bonus
e
bikes
scooters
are
much
more
affordable
than
ev
cars
and
use
batteries
more
efficiently
per
pound
housing
and
transportation
go
hand
in
hand
i
bought
2
model
3
s
this
year
both
used
the
first
was
a
2023
rwd
that
cost
me
25k
and
the
2nd
is
a
2021
awd
i
bought
for
26
900
both
had
less
than
30k
miles
and
a
charge
cost
me
800
it
d
actually
way
cheaper
than
people
think
and
i
ve
had
nothing
but
pure
enjoyment
driving
both
so
far
i
did
trade
in
the
rwd
for
the
awd
so
i
don
t
currently
own
both
but
the
point
remains
i
bought
my
2020
corolla
hybrid
for
22k
brand
new
nobody
wanted
the
things
right
before
the
covid
car
disaster
at
almost
at
70k
miles
and
still
getting
52
55
mpg
depending
on
the
tires
best
purchase
i
ever
made
especially
since
i
just
paid
it
off
yeah
for
that
scenario
people
would
need
convenient
access
to
fast
charging
though
it
d
mean
spending
15
minutes
or
so
at
a
charger
every
so
often
not
as
convenient
but
doable
lol
an
ev
not
a
golf
cart
most
get
as
much
or
more
than
their
gas
counterparts
these
days
wow
when
you
put
it
like
that
that
is
brutal
i
knew
nj
was
going
to
find
a
way
to
make
up
for
the
missing
gas
taxes
but
this
seems
like
overkill
an
ev
will
cost
the
owner
way
less
to
own
than
an
ice
car
even
with
the
250
year
surcharge
the
real
savings
is
in
the
fuel
cost
especially
when
charging
at
home
and
the
overall
maintenance
costs
being
drastically
lower
for
evs
gas
tax
amounts
to
45
a
gallon
in
2025
if
a
car
or
vehicle
gets
about
25
miles
per
gallon
that
s
still
360
a
year
that
owner
is
paying
in
gas
taxes
the
250
is
narrowing
the
gap
but
still
in
favor
of
the
ev
at
20
000
miles
a
year
weight
mileage
i
think
the
main
problem
with
the
registration
pricing
is
it
doesn
t
just
make
up
for
the
lost
gas
taxes
it
exceeds
them
by
a
lot
in
the
vast
majority
of
cases
i
have
no
problem
paying
a
road
maintenance
fee
in
my
registration
but
i
m
not
sure
how
it
s
fair
that
it
s
something
like
twice
the
amount
that
i
paid
through
gasoline
taxes
with
my
previous
car
which
was
literally
the
same
car
but
with
a
gas
engine
agree
but
the
new
registration
cost
is
beyond
what
the
gas
tax
is
especially
since
we
bought
electric
due
to
not
driving
much
less
than
10
000mpy
we
wouldn
t
be
spending
that
much
in
gas
tax
during
a
year
almost
like
they
don
t
want
you
to
have
an
ev
dropping
the
tax
credit
is
going
to
hurt
sales
that
s
been
a
major
boon
for
ev
adoption
tariffs
are
going
to
hurt
sales
because
prices
are
going
to
go
up
i
had
a
2019
hyundai
ioniq
electric
which
only
had
a
range
of
about
120
miles
i
started
driving
more
for
work
and
i
just
couldn
t
make
do
with
that
small
of
a
range
anymore
so
i
sold
it
for
a
2020
hyundai
ioniq
plug
in
i
loved
everything
else
about
the
car
so
i
basically
bought
the
same
one
while
ev
fires
are
hard
to
put
out
much
of
this
is
just
unfounded
fear
of
evs
you
have
to
look
at
who
staffs
a
lot
of
these
volunteer
fire
departments
trumpy
boomers
people
who
want
noisy
loud
v8s
evs
threaten
that
so
we
have
to
gin
up
fear
at
all
costs
ev
fires
do
happen
but
not
as
nearly
as
often
as
some
would
want
you
to
believe
the
problem
is
we
are
building
condos
in
areas
like
wayne
which
is
not
a
walkable
bikeable
place
have
you
driven
the
new
my
i
dont
have
a
tesla
but
a
friend
is
on
his
new
my
and
said
the
improvements
to
the
suspension
and
build
quality
are
lightyears
apart
compared
to
his
old
one
i
puzzled
over
this
for
a
bit
800
to
charge
up
then
i
realized
that
what
you
meant
was
800
for
a
charger
yep
not
only
are
you
paying
less
per
mile
but
you
paid
at
least
half
of
what
an
ev
costs
and
i
say
this
as
an
ev
early
adopter
lover
i
m
hoping
by
the
time
it
s
mass
adoption
charging
will
be
faster
imagine
having
250kw
charging
for
the
entirety
of
the
charge
i
believe
solid
state
is
capable
but
that
s
still
years
away
may
i
speak
freely
i
m
comparing
my
car
a
chevy
bolt
to
the
typical
4
door
compact
like
a
honda
fit
or
civic
or
toyota
corolla
that
gets
35mpg
or
more
they
have
to
go
20k
miles
in
a
year
to
pay
the
assumed
cost
of
my
road
usage
i
only
drive
10k
a
year
in
this
little
car
so
this
is
a
disincentive
my
other
gas
cars
more
than
make
up
for
the
fuel
taxes
a
v10
a
v8
and
an
i4
that
part
i
agree
with
you
i
wish
there
s
better
way
to
charge
by
both
weight
and
mileage
then
we
create
better
infrastructure
it
s
a
solvable
problem
with
known
solutions
there
are
plenty
of
similar
density
municipalities
in
other
places
with
far
better
transportation
options
i
agree
that
some
roads
in
wayne
aren
t
comfortable
to
bike
or
walk
on
take
hamburg
turnpike
for
instance
in
some
places
it
s
two
narrow
lanes
in
each
direction
no
shoulder
no
sidewalk
in
others
there
s
a
sidewalk
but
it
s
interrupted
by
parking
lot
entrances
and
a
jersey
barrier
preventing
left
turn
access
people
routinely
drive
50
mph
on
that
now
imagine
an
alternate
reality
where
there
s
sidewalk
wide
bike
path
trees
lane
turning
lane
lane
trees
sidewalk
that
would
take
no
more
space
but
be
able
to
accommodate
many
more
travelers
treat
the
major
roads
and
intersections
like
that
add
some
strategic
bike
pedestrian
cut
throughs
to
link
disconnected
neighborhoods
now
you
ve
got
a
network
which
many
more
people
would
be
more
comfortable
using
including
people
of
all
ages
it
can
be
better
if
we
recognize
the
spatial
issue
like
you
rightfully
do
i
have
not
my
only
experience
with
tesla
is
the
m3
and
i
m
a
total
fan
boy
now
yes
800
to
buy
the
in
home
charger
and
have
it
installed
i
was
driving
a
f150
and
spending
over
100
week
in
gas
so
it
pays
for
itself
in
2
months
for
me
at
least
but
i
do
a
ton
of
driving
i
d
also
want
to
see
more
reliable
chargers
and
standardization
of
the
handshake
implemented
everywhere
having
to
keep
multiple
apps
for
multiple
chargers
is
ridiculous
it
should
be
simple
plug
n
charge
everywhere
it

rep
jeff
van

just
said
on
fox
that
iran
launched
drones
from
a
mothership
off
the
east
coast
says
his
sources
are
high
sources
high
sources
maybe
the
high
sources
should
cut
back
on
their
trips
to
the

iran
is
so
overleveraged
they
couldn
t
stop
the
destruction
of
two
of
their
biggest
allies
in
the
middle
east
yet
they
have
time
to
put
on
a
light
show
in
new

what
a
clown
fuck
that
guy
good
grief
what
happens
when
you
fill
the
federal
government
with
incompetents
nepo
kids
and
grifters
we
re
all
about
to
find
out
together
iran
got
caught
with
their
pants
down
when
israel
planted
explosives
in
all
of
hezbollah
s
pagers
but
sure
they
re
capable
of
launching
amphibious
drones
just
off
of
barnegat
light
hmm
lmfao
if
iran
is
the
country
doing
this
and
we
are
powerless
to
stop
iran
then
we
are
so
cooked
lol
and
i
bet
they
were
eating
the
dogs
and
cats
while
performing
transgender
surgeries
during
recess
too
and
we
should
trust
anything
coming
from
van
drew
or
fox
because
good
thing
the
iranians
put
bright
flashing
lights
on
their
drones
so
that
we
wouldn

spying
us

these

launching

ok
i
finally

safe
now
if
this
came
from
van

every

out

is
a
lie
we
know
this
because
of
the

i
doubt
any
part
of
it
is
true
if
it
was
the

guard
or
navy
would
stop
it
most
likely
his

are
high
on
something
i
m
in
colorado
and
about
5
years
ago
we
had
drone
sightings
like
you
are
having
unfortunately
they
went
away
and
we
didn
t
get
any
answers
if
it
came
from
anyone
else
i
might
actually
believe
it
mothership
like
the

mothership
from
the

move
good
news
that
there
is
only
one

anyone
getting

we

true
or
not

it

force

what
the

going

oh
they
re

all
right
they
were
smoking
everything
but
their

guys
maybe
this
is
a
good
thing
if
people
keep
saying
absolutely
insane
shit
maybe
the
government
will
fess
up
to
what
the
drones
actually
are
nothing
on
fox
entertainment
should
be
considered
a
reputable
source
lol
i
mean
he
s
a
bigot
so
so
the
united
states
military
has
no
evidence
of
an
iranian
mothership
off
the
coast
something
large
enough
to
cross
the
atlantic
and
iran
is
using
drones
with
faa
approved
lighting
for
this
sneak
attack
surveillance
this
is
insanity

yo

no
he
did
not
confirm
these

are
coming
from
an
iranian
mothership
what
he
did
say
was
that
an
iranian
drone
mothership
left
its

and
the
timing
coincides
with
what
is
seen
in

he
also
stated
it
could
be

i
m
not
saying
he
s
not
a

because
he
is
but
the
silence
from

absolutely
why

the

that

last

dont

bidden

did
you
not
watch
the

you

iran
launched
a

probably
about
a
month
ago
that
contains
these
drones
that
mothership
is
off
i
m
gonna
tell
you
the
deal
that
mothership
is
off
the
east
cost
of
the
united
states
of
america
they
ve
launched
drones
well
when
you
have
a

pulling
a

at
bernies
and
a
skank
for
a

what
could
you
expect
sure
did
and
i
heard
him
say
he
thinks
thats
it
i
also
read
the
official
announcement
that
says
whether
this
is
a
foreign
adversary
or
even
just
a
group
of

i
would
suggest
you
go
to
hospital
for
special
surgery
in
ny
there
are
satellite
offices
in
nj
too
they
are
the
number
1
hospital
in
the
country
for
orthopedic
surgery
if
you
call
the
main
number
they
can
connect
you
to
someone
who
can
take
your
info
and
help
find
the
right
surgeon
for
you
to
at
least
get
a
second
opinion
i
had
one
complicated
surgery
there
my
mom
had
two
surgeries
there
it
is
without
a
doubt
the
best
place
to
have
complicated
surgeries
like
you
re
talking
about
for
my
complicated
surgery
i
interviewed
5
or
6
different
surgeons
in
nj
then
went
to
hss
and
the
difference
was
immediately
obvious
which
is
why
i
chose
them
not
the
same
issue
but
rwj
did
lifesaving
surgery
on
my
father
who
ended
up
needing
open
heart
surgery
last
february
afterwards
we
did
have
to
kinda
be
on
top
of
the
nurses
at
times
post
op
to
make
sure
my
dad
was
getting
the
attention
he
needed
but
iirc
that
s
common
because
of
the
nurse
shortage
edit
double
checked
with
a
family
member
just
now
and
this
is
also
the
place
that
removed
a
tumor
that
essentially
wrapped
around
my
cousin
s
spine
he
survived
and
even
was
able
to
walk
after
ymmv
because
of
course
all
surgeons
are
different
but
it
gave
my
cousin
s
spine
another
15
years
he
passed
away
from
something
other
than
his
back
issues
and
was
able
to
walk
post
surgery
really
a
miracle
case
tbh
it
all
depends
on
your
surgeon
but
robert
wood
is
a
teaching
school
and
is
very
good

rwj
hamilton
or
new
brunswick
and
which
surgeon
did
they
recommend
would
you
maybe
be
better
at
the
hospital
of
special
surgeries
they
have
an
extremely
low
infection
rate
rwj
in
new
brunswick
did
3
surgeries
for
family
members
in
the
past
18
months
i
would
recommend
them
i
worked
at
rwj
new
brunswick
for
almost
10
years
it
is
a
good
hospital
for
different
things
if
i
got
shot
i
d
trust
my
care
there
podiatry
i
m
not
too
familiar
with
how
well
regarded
their
service
is
but
my
experience
dealing
with
them
personally
in
the
hospital
has
been
nothing
but
positive
i
ve
had
multiple
surgeries
at
rwj
bridgewater
and
morristown
medical
i
would
recommend
either
even
though
i
prefer
morristown
medical
it
just
feels
more
modern
to
me
that
said
i
agree
with
u
smilefirstthenspeak
et
al
about
seeing
a
specialist
surgeon
for
something
like
this
rwj
win
i
don
t
have
any
experience
with
that
hospital
but
i
just
want
to
say
i
am
so
sorry
you
are
going
thru
this
if
it
s
okay
i
would
like
to
share
that
my
mother
went
through
the
same
exact
thing
about
15
years
ago
it
happened
from
a
knee
break
surgery
gone
horribly
wrong
she
ended
up
having
multiple
20
surgeries
between
skin
grafts
and
debridings
her
legs
was
severely
damaged
and
she
had
atrophy
to
her
foot
they
called
it
foot
drop
where
it
looked
like
she
was
wearing
a
high
heel
however
due
to
nerve
damage
she
did
not
having
any
feeling
from
the
knee
down
and
opted
to
have
her
achilles
essentially
clipped
to
place
her
foot
back
into
position
she
taught
herself
to
walk
again
after
many
doctors
said
she
wouldn
t
she
was
very
strong
willed
thank
you
for
listening
and
i
wish
you
luck
on
your
journey
here
sending
you
positive
thoughts
you
are
strong
call
a
malpractice
lawyer
i
went
to
rwj
in
new
brunswick
to
give
birth
and
had
a
fabulous
time
i
had
kidney
stone
issues
later
and
it
was
a
severely
traumatic
experience
with
little
follow
up
care
but
every
nurse
i
ever
encountered
there
was
amazing
i
would
say
as
long
as
your
specific
practice
is
adequately
staffed
with
support
staff
it
was
like
one
np
for
30
doctors
in
urology
you
ll
be
fine
but
if
not
i
would
hard
reccomend
against
it
they
basically
told
me
to
use
the
er
for
any
follow
up
issues
don
t
recommend
i
was
in
a
car
accident
in
2020
and
i
still
cant
walk
correctly
billing
was
also
a
nightmare
every
surgery
that
i
had
there
had
to
be
revised
to
some
degree
it
depends
on
the
doctors
but
i
went
to
princeton
ortho
to
fix
everything
rwj
is
my
preferred
hospital
in
the
entire
southern
region
of
nj
no
recommendations
just
want
to
say
sorry
you
went
through
that
i
have
some
health
issues
and
i
m
just
learning
that
i
need
to
be
my
own
advocate
best
wishes
after
living
by
there
and
knowing
people
who
have
gone
there
i
don
t
think
i
would
go
by
choice
to
have
a
major
procedure
done
at
rwj
nb
like
many
said
here
check
out
hss
i
work
in
healthcare
and
also
highly
recommend
hss
another
vote
for
hss
i
had
two
ankle
surgeries
with
dr
scott
ellis
they
are
superior
in
my
opinion
the
thing
is
that
i
don
t
need
an
orthopedic
surgeon
for
my
amputation
since
it
s
such
a
complicated
and
unique
case
a
plastic
surgeon
would
be
my
way
to
go
i
met
with
3
orthopedic
surgeons
and
all
told
me
to
go
to
a
plastic
surgeon
basically
they
have
to
amputate
and
reconstruct
from
the
back
of
my
calf
where
i
have
a
good
amount
of
soft
tissue
left
and
place
it
on
the
left
side
of
my
leg
to
avoid
phantom
leg
symptoms
and
pinching
the
nerves
bc
i
have
0
soft
tissue
there
it
s
literally
just
bone
and
skin
graft
but
thank
you
i
am
going
to
look
into
hss
hopefully
they
take
my
insurance
one
more
consult
would
certainly
not
hurt
wow
that
is
amazing
thank
you
for
sharing
this
is
actually
a
good
question
i
didn
t
realize
there
were
two
campuses
my
review
is
for
the
new
brunswick
branch
what
about
rwj
bridgewater
new
brunswick
dr
jeremy
sinkin
definitely
going
to
look
into
it
i
didn
t
know
a
place
like
that
existed
thanks
thank
you
so
much
for
sharing
i
m
sorry
to
hear
about
your
mom
i
also
have
drop
foot
and
like
3
orthos
i
consulted
with
told
me
if
it
was
just
that
and
not
damaged
skin
and
nerves
they
would
be
able
to
save
my
leg
but
the
constant
chronic
pain
i
have
and
very
damaged
leg
they
can
t
do
much
thank
you
i
guess
when
i
have
my
appointment
with
this
surgeon
i
can
check
out
if
his
department
is
adequately
staffed
that
s
a
great
tip
they
recommend
new
brunswick
i
am
so
sorry
you
are
in
so
much
pain
i
ll
be
honest
in
retrospect
it
probably
would
have
been
better
for
her
to
have
gone
with
the
below
the
knee
amputation
she
was
in
and
out
of
the
hospital
constantly
and
it
really
did
wear
her
down
unfortunately
so
i
just
wanna
say
as
difficult
as
a
decision
to
make
i
think
you
are
making
the
best
decision
and
will
have
a
much
better
quality
of
life
i
also
just
noticed
your
reddit
name
i
m
also
mom
to
a
julian
great
minds
yeah
that
s
what
all
the
orthos
and
physical
therapists
i
ve
consulted
with
also
told
me
if
i
want
a
better
quality
of
life
an
amputation
would
be
the
way
to
go
it
s
very
scary
and
sad
reality
but
i
think
i
ll
be
much
happier
pain
free

again
awww
julians
are
the
best
how
it
s
not
the
pitch
pine
is
beyond
me
i
have
seen
red
oaks
in
sheltered
areas
that
held
their
leaves
until
spring
but
it
is
kind
of
suprising
to
see
japanese
maples
holding
onto
there
leaves
at
this
time
of
the
year
here
in
monmouth
county
with
bacterial
leaf
scorch
ripping
through
the
state
how
long
will
it
stay
the
state
tree
depends
on
where
you
live
i
guess
for
real
it
should
have
been
the
pitch
pine
instead
of
a
common
red
oak
salem
county
also
as
a

note

giphy
v5e9orfepbpsc
was
just
coming
to
post
this
i
posted
a
10
minute
video
with
about
15
clips
of
airplanes
and
planets
in
the
night
sky
filmed
with
a
powerful
telephoto
lens
to
the
njdrones
subreddit
the
goal
was
that
people
can
compare
what
they
feel
is
a
drone
against
routine
air
activity
the
video
has
comparisons
of
what
the
same
thing
looks
like
when
filmed
with
cell
phone
versus
camera
my
apologies
for
another
drone
post
i
am
growing
worried
about
mass
hysteria
growing
and
someone
pointing
a
laser
or
flying
a
consumer
drone
towards
a
commercial
aircraft
edit
i
clicked
shit
post
and
dumbass
thread
flairs
but
they
do
not
seem
to
be
on
display
only
bread
milk
i
want
to
be
probed
they
know
its
just
none
of
our
concern
we
re
unsure
quite
how
exactly
to
lie
to
you
saw
picatinny
confirmed
11
drone
sightings
while
earle
dix
lakehurst
essentially
said
meh
tells
me
all
i
need
to
know
shoot
one
down
and
see
who
gets
pissed
they
know
they
also
know
you
know
they
don
t
know
that
i
know
that
they
know
that
you
know
but
they
will
you
know
if
no
one
truly
knows
we
look
like
a
jackass
of
a
country
right
now
what
would
happen
if
a
bad
actor
were
to
launch
a
true
aerial
assault
using
devices
like
these
to
release
some
sort
of
contaminant
into
our
air
or
cause
some
other
unknown
harm
to
our
populace
would
we
just
let
them
fly
around
up
there
indefinitely
until
we
start
dropping
dead
then
our
government
would
mull
about
pointing
fingers
at
each
other
because
too
little
was
done
too
late
if
our
military
doesn
t
care
about
them
they
re
incompetent
to
a
level
that
i
did
not
think
possible
or
they
already
know
what
they
are
and
what
their
purpose
is
and
are
choosing
not
to
act
damn
between
the
nypd
wasting
thousands
of
man
hours
and
millions
of
dollars
trying
to
find
an
assassin
only
for
them
to
get
shown
up
by
a
mcdonald
s
worker
and
the
nj
government
saying
we
don
t
know
lol
about
a
stark
increase
in
evening
drone
activity
the
institutions
and
powers
that
be
have
been
taking
massive
ls
lately
no
wonder
people
hate
the
establishment
they
can
t
even
do
the
most
basic
things
its
just
weird
because
why
wouldn
t
they
just
say
we
re
training
new
people
with
drones
or
something
this
total
non
acknowledgement
just
keeps
me
at
unease
they
sent
a
fighter
jet
to
shoot
down
a
weather
balloon
you
re
telling
me
they
can
t
shoot
down
a
drone
i
call
bullshit
they
know
they
re
not
telling
us
this
community
should
be
able
to
pull
together
to
solve
this
scooby
doo
mystery
after
a
lot
of
hijinks
and
shennanigans
also
a
big
ol
hootenanny
is
due
at
the
end
of
the
mystery
resolution
where
all
the
characters
do
a
jig
together
while
we
all
laugh
our
asses
off
at
ourselves
folks
i
keep
saying
we
should
just
shoot
the
drones
the
fbi
and
local
officials
are
telling
us
they
don
t
know
whose
they
are
that
means
they
are
free
game
shoot
the
fuckers
already
dammit
either
they
know
and
they
re
lying
to
us
which
makes
me
suspicious
or
they
truly
don
t
know
which
makes
me
worried
if
we
turn
the
windmills
on
maybe
we
can
blow
them
away
i
can
t
have
this
conversation
again
feds
can
find
russian
ships
near
alaska
but
this
is
unknown
so
a
big
portion
of
this
hearing
revolved
how
they
want
to
make
sure
that
something
is
renewed
by
congress
for
them
to
keep
working
on
drone
countermeasures
but
this
includes
things
that
would
allow
them
to
bypass
warrants
to
access
electronic
devices
i
don
t
think
it
s
a
coincidence
that
these
drones
started
appearing
recently
when
this
is
all
happening
puts
it
into
the
public
sphere
and
makes
us
more
receptive
for
them
to
get
the
approval
that
they
need
these
drones
above
us
have
to
be
the
feds
then
why
are
we
not
taking
one
down
fly
em
over
south
jersey
i
m
sure
a
licensed
civilian
would
find
everyone
some
answers
i
think
if
anyone
has
a
high
powered
lens
that
they
can
mount
and
add
any
night
filters
available
for
light
enhancement
and
just
track
the
right
area
could
catch
anything
at
night
as
far
as
a
chassis
is
concerned
something
that
could
be
looked
up
like
some
new
air
taxi
or
really
specific
drone
i
went
out
with
my
binocs
a
few
nights
ago
to
have
a
look
at
the
night
sky
and
there
is
just
traffic
all
over
the
place
at
night
with
all
the
different
airports
around
one
thing
i
saw
that
was
strange
star
that
i
swear
it
had
blinking
lights
like
red
and
green
like
a
hovering
drone
maybe
doing
area
surveillance
maybe
nothing
in
the
shaky
view
lies
and
the
the
lying
liars
who
tell
them
maybe
they
should
investigate
yes
like
those
chinses
spy
drones
a
few
years
back
that
was
just
people
fucking
around
these
drones
are
the
jewish
space
lazers
mounted
on
the
democrate
weather
dominator
to
frame
a
poor
italian
kid
for
killing
a
ceo
in
a
false
flag
operation
to
make
the
frogs
gay
gif
giphy
oohjwtt6rkk6i
okay
so
what
we
know
is
they
need
money
they
are
drones
they
are
unmanned
they
are
man
made
they
are
not
shooting
them
down
or
using
electric
impulse
technology
to
subdue
them
and
take
them
down
this
leads
me
to
think
they
are
either
chinese
made
drones
or
american
made
drones
possibly
american
because
they
can
test
how
many
people
call
and
in
a
populated
state
they
can
see
how
many
people
per
mile
notice
possibly
chinese
if
they
want
to
put
people
in
a
panic
before
trump
takes
office
they
are
located
near
morristown
and
bedminster
and
north
jersey
what
strategic
items
are
in
north
jersey
lol
yeah
sure
almost
like
they
want
us
to
focus
more
on
luigi
than
these
drones
lie
i
don
t
believe
it
why
don
t
they
send
out
a
task
force
to
blow
them
up
out
of
the
sky
ok
i
know
the
debris
would
not
be
welcome
but
c
mon
now
they
know
so
no
one
has
attempted
to
follow
any
of
them
to
see
where
they
land
they
don
t
know
what
it
is
because
it
s
a
snipe
hunt
the
governor
of
new
jersey
should
get
an
attack
helicopter
from
the
national
guard
and
shoot
down
a
drone
i
know
you
know
and
i
know
you
know
i
know
you
know
i
have
a
few
thoughts
but
on
a
tangent
not
seen
yet
maybe
it
s
amazon
and
walmart
conditioning
us
for
their
future
air
drone
delivery
services
the
boxy
blue
amazon
delivery
trucks
seem
to
be
half
the
traffic
on
my
road
these
days
if
it
all
goes
airborne
then
we
ll
have
potentially
hundreds
of
these
things
flying
overhead
all
day
long
recently
one
of
those
amazon
trucks
slid
off
the
road
and
needed
to
be
towed
out
so
i
m
not
looking
forward
to
some
50
lb
drone
crashing
to
the
ground
or
my
roof
if
it
was
military
wouldn
t
they
be
testing
out
in
a
desert
somewhere
or
maybe
they
re
at
the
point
the
tech
needs
suburban
urban
testing
so
grab
a
helicopter
with
a
net
and
grab
one
of
these
things
already
they
trailed
a
coast
guard
ship
they
re
over
the
ocean
at
that
point
and
can
be
shot
down
but
aren
t
totally
not
the
government
lying
to
us
new
jersey
is
a
great
place
to
live
we
have
drones
flying
over
our
heads
no
one
knows
who
and
what
they
are
but
we
are
being
told
not
to
worry
there
is
no
potential
threat
on
the
other
note
for
upcoming
santacon
you
won
t
be
able
to
bring
any
liquids
to
the
public
transportation
not
even
water
so
flying
saucers
no
worries
bottle
of
water
danger
to
public
is
this
really
happening
like
are
we
really
that
naive
so
no
one
s
going
to
tell
us
what
s
going
on
so
is
it
the
sightings
that
are
concerning
or
the
drones
themselves
at
this
point
i
think
it
s
the
former
when
the
government
is
ready
to
tell
us
they
will
until
then
just
put
your
head
down
and
mind
your
business
it
s
what
they
expect
you
to
do
i
don
t
give
a
fuck
what
some
dude
from
texas
thinks
about
our
drones
shotgun
has
anyone
managed
to
throw
rocks
at
any
of
these
or
shoot
one
down
i
m
well
aware
there
are
probably
legal
issues
with
that
but
at
least
it
d
mean
the
owner
would
have
to
come
foward
and
press
charges
which
would
expose
the
identity
of
the
individual
or
individuals
involved
in
this
drone
mayhem
if
this
has
already
happened
and
no
one
s
come
forward
my
money
is
definitely
on
someone
trolling
us
maybe
college
kids
with
money
or
maybe
someone
older
and
weathering
who
acts
like
a
college
kid
or
some
sort
of
crazy
viral
ad
campaign
at
least
when
the
monolith
thing
happened
that
was
fun
but
30
to
50
drones
a
night
is
absolutely
insane
my
boss
says
he
saw
one
hovering
over
the
power
station
in
branchburg
how
large
are
these
drones
are
they
military
sized
or
commercial
sized
drug
smugglers
dropping
off
fentanyl
don
t
look
up
i
live
in
manhattan
and
first
noticed
weird
drones
in
the
sky
in
late
october
i
was
out
on
my
balcony
and
saw
something
flying
in
an
unusual
pattern
definitely
not
like
any
plane
or
helicopter
i
ve
seen
at
first
it
kinda
freaked
me
out
and
i
thought
we
might
be
under
attack
now
i
see
them
pretty
frequently
i
assumed
they
are
some
kind
of
drone
but
why
would
the
government
pretend
they
don
t
know
what
it
is
that
makes
the
whole
thing
weirder
again
serious
question
how
difficult
would
it
be
for
someone
to
track
where
they
fucking
land
they
are
the
size
of
an
suv
and
have
lights
everyone
can
see
even
with
lights
off
residents
in
nj
surely
have
drones
with
night
vision
that
would
be
up
to
the
task
right
i
say
this
knowing
it
has
to
be
military
but
if
they
play
dumb
and
deny
it
what
s
stopping
someone
with
a
drone
hobby
from
investigating
stupid
is
as
stupid
does
didnt
one
wreck
last
night
just
blast
them
with
paintball
honestly
could
be
china
they
re
huge
on
drone
swarms
or
russia
these
could
just
be
mapping
drones
or
they
could
be
dispersing
chemical
biological
weapons
that
have
a
delayed
effect
they
could
be
strapped
with
explosives
eventually
who
the
hell
knows
but
by
all
means
let
s
sit
around
with
our
thumb
up
our
ass
and
say
that
we
have
no
reason
to
be
concerned
about
the
overhead
drone
swarms
it
s
probably
amazon
delivering
packages
or
smth
you
guys
are
tripping
it
s
just
the
giants
searching
for
a
quarterback
i
think
they
actually
do
not
know
they
do
not
looking
like
idiots
it
s
really
funny
that
the
fbi
isn
t
allowed
to
just
come
out
and
say
there
aren
t
any
nefarious
drones
you
re
working
yourselves
up
over
normal
air
traffic
so
they
have
to
say
things
like
this
and
the
people
rile
themselves
up
even
more
its
china
operation
bluebeam
bruh
it
s
very
obviously
aliens
guys
and
gals
pack
your
rifles
what
do
you
think
of
this

shoot
one
down
and
someones
gonna
find
out
real
quick
im
sure
i
feel
like
if
it
wasnt
our
concern
they
would
be
far
more
assuring
of
our
safety
considering
the
amount
of
attention
its
getting
at
this
point
that
type
of
thinking
when
they
re
flying
these
over
neighborhoods
can
fuck
completely
right
the
fuck
off
how
unbelievably
condescending
and
belittling
no
he
s
probably
telling
the
truth
the
government
isn
t
some
big
entity
coordinated
by
someone
who
knows
everything
that
s
going
on
there
s
always
been
a
small
group
of
people
who
know
the
full
story
about
ufos
and
they
lie
to
everyone
else
this
secrecy
is
about
money
the
ufo
reverse
engineering
programs
with
the
defense
contractors
as
alleged
repeatedly
by
the
witnesses
at
the
congressional
hearings
on
november
13
and
before
that
in
2023
money
is
the
reason
the
senate
majority
leader
can
t
get
the
uap
disclosure
act
passed
after
introducing
it
multiple
years
in
a
row
if
schumer
s
64
page
act
which
uses
non
human
intelligence
at
least
60
times
was
just
nonsense
then
mike
turner
who
represents
the
district
where
the
rumors
have
consistently
said
the
crashed
craft
were
stored
wouldn
t
have
torpedoed
the
act
in
the
house
intelligence
committee
two
consecutive
times
and
donald
trump
would
have
followed
through
with
his
promise
in
2016
to
declassify
the
ufo
files
it
s
just
common
sense
that
people
don
t
spend
political
capital
to
overclassify
stuff
if
there
s
no
there
there
so
the
fbi
is
almost
certainly
telling
the
truth
they
have
absolutely
no
idea
what
s
happening
because
the
people
who
do
know
are
corrupt
politicians
who
are
panicking
right
now
if
the
non
human
intelligence
continues
to
cause
these
drone
sightings
where
the
drones
are
never
found
and
mysteriously
go
dark
or
disappear
into
the
ocean
people
will
actually
and
finally
start
to
take
what
all
the
former
government
officials
have
been
saying
about
aliens
for
80
years
seriously
rather
than
demeaning
them
or
downvoting
posts
like
mine
that
bring
this
to
people
s
attention
the
problem
is
that
for
these
politicians
acknowledgment
means
big
jail
time
because
at
the
core
of
the
whole
situation
is
that
these
unacknowledged
sap
programs
do
exist
they
never
were
reported
to
congress
and
now
we
finally
have
the
reason
why
the
pentagon
has
failed
its
last
7
audits
by
billions
and
billions
of
dollars
some
of
this
money
was
illegally
allocated
to
studying
the
non
human
intelligence
and
undoubtedly
a
lot
of
it
was
simply
spent
by
people
in
the
programs
on
personal
expenditures
that
s
what
happens
when
there
s
no
oversight
if
you
are
confused
by
what
s
going
on
here
or
have
just
started
following
this
topic
i
would
encourage
those
in
new
jersey
to
watch
the
hearings
and
do
some
research
into
the
allegations
all
of
the
behavior
going
on
right
now
is
exactly
100
consistent
with
what
we
know
and
has
been
testified
to
under
oath
from
the
stolen
funds
to
the
characteristics
of
the
drones
that
aren
t
drones
all
the
way
to
the
expected
timetable
of
2024
2027
they
need
a
gen
z
pr
person
to
take
over
their
communications
so
the
lies
are
covered
up
with
unserious
shitty
video
edits
that
do
nothing
but
confuse
people
further
until
the
general
public
just
gives
up
it
s
luigi
again
i
feel
like
this
is
the
case
because
the
drones
are
still
following
rules
about
having
lights
on
if
it
really
were
aliens
or
another
country
wouldn
t
they
do
it
in
a
more
stealthy
way
either
that
or
they

what

anybody
don

what
would

if
a

were

a
true

assault
using
devices
like
these
to
release
some
sort

cause
some
other
unknown
harm
to

populace
crop
dusting
drones
are
already
a
thing
the
nypd
put
in

the
mcdonald

worker
didn
t
just
intuit
out
of
thin
air
that
the
person
in
the

was
the
assassin
the
nypd
had
to
track
the
guy
to
the
hostel
get
the
photos
and
distribute
them
to
news
networks
specifically
so
that
somebody
would
recognize
him
but
yeah
somebody
should
know
something
about
the
drones
by
now
they
can
do
the
most
basic
things
they
re
just
getting
worse
at
lying
to
you
well
said
they
could
but
it
would
endanger
the
lives
of
innocent
people
they
waited
until
the
balloon
was
over
the
ocean
to
shoot
it
down
because
the
drones
are
at
low
altitude
it
would
make
shooting
them
down
even
more
dangerous
probably
dhs
ordering
them
to
keep
things
under
wraps
i
have
not
been
concerned
with
these
things

what

idea
why
not
do
it
yourself
even
if
it
was

to
shoot
in

it
isn

people

from

it

very

you

your

i

they
throw
your

in

for
suggesting
it
when
someone
does
this
and
kills
a

pilot
shooting
in
the
air
is
a
bad
idea
especially
around
where
these
are
being
seen
i
d
rather
deal
with
a

than
a
01
chance
of
being
convicted

manslaughter
from

what
do
you

happens

you

does
it
fall

down

i
d
prefer
to

on

speculate
wildly
stupid
idea
my
boss
told
me
he
saw
a
unicorn
small
suv
i
like
this
idea
but
why
not
use
cheap
disposable
drones
a
bus
sized
drone
would
have
to
cost
hundreds
of
thousands
there
doesn
t
seem
to
be
any
pilots
with
good
drones
in
nj
at
the
moment
it
seems
missed
opportunity
for
american
drone
companies
to
show
off
their
tech
and
get
footage
that
said
the
rumor
is
they
were
coming
from
the
ocean
no
one
knows
where
they
landed
that
s
what
they
want
you
to
think
i
too
do
not
looking
like
idiots
you
re
working
yourselves
up
over
normal
air
traffic
have
you
not
watched
any
of
the
countless
videos
what
about
that
is
normal
why
are
dozens
of
mayors
screaming
for
answers
why
are
local
police
departments
putting
their
own
resources
into
investing
you
must
have
some
info
they
don
t
the
other
answers
you
re
getting
is
why
people
are
convinced
the
drone
swarm
is
real
if
you
say
it
s
not
then
you
re
either
in
denial
or
part
of
a
massive
coverup
and
if
you
re
the
fbi
they
re
going
to
pick
coverup
thanks
for
the
waste
of
time
thats
irresponsible
to
discharge
a
firearm
into
the
air
in
nj
i
do
remember
seeing
drone
catching
drones
that
carry
big
nets
we
wouldn
t
need
a
big
one
to
snare
a
couple
props
and
bring
one
down
i
betcha
wed
figure
it
right
out
if
anyone
does
shoot
one
down
they
should
use
salt
buckshot
rounds
with
a
shotgun
good
scatter
and
not
lethal
i
will
attempt
to
shoot
one
of
these
drones
with
an
air
defense
ciws
system
firing
100
rounds
of
20mm
explosive
cannon
shells
a
second
i
guarantee
that
that
1
round
of
the
100
that
i
fire
will
hit
the
drone
the
other
99
will
drop
back
down
to
earth
and
preferably
hit
the
house
of
the
karen
running
the
hoa
you
starting
to
get
the
picture
of
why
we
cant
just
shoot
it
down
just
like
bigfoot
no
bones
from
a
dead
one
no
hair
no
poop
absolutely
nothing
has
even
been
found
yet
people
are
convinced
they
exist
if
these
drones
were
as
common
and
low
flying
as
everyone
seems
to
think
they
are
there
would
have
already
been
one
that
was
shot
down
caught
in
a
tree
or
crashed
that
something
a
dumb
ass
will
say
please
stop
advocating
for
people
to
shoot
pedestrian
firearms
up

there

in

you

hit
it

that
bullet
gonna
come

imo
anyone
talking
about
shooting
drones
out
of
the
sky
is
a
direct
threat
to
the
life
of
their
neighbors
that
thought
is
so
so
so
dangerously
stupid
that
it
s
incredible
you
haven
t
already
died
from
eating
dcon
on

or
something
as
a

and
there
was
a
recent
call
for

because
of
them
my

is
directly
in

when
it
s
cloudy
you
hear
loud
rumbling
every

if
i
were
to
launch
a
drone
its
setting
off
a
ground
stop
at
ewr
and
faa
will
show
up
at
my

i
genuinely
believe
its
classified
military
testing
the

here
does
sound
condescending
russia
already
does
a
pretty
good
job
with
this
skibidi
toilet
for

yeah
i
was
gonna
say
i
was
about
to
watch
this
but
got
bored
because
there
was
no
subway
surfers
gameplay
on
the
side
i
think
the
only
argument
against
the
stealth
approach
could
come
from
a
foreign
bad
actor
s
familiarity
with
our
laws
and
basically
an
understanding
that
these
drones
if
operated
within
the
guidelines
of
local
and
federal
laws
can
t
be
shot
down
essentially
i
don
t
know
if
they
re
china
or
my
neighbor
flying
them
nor
does
anyone
here
on
the
ground
and
so
you
can
t
just
go
shooting
them
down
because
you
run
into
the
issue
of
infringing
upon
civil
liberties
i
know
it
s
an
easy
choice
for
me
sitting
here
in
my
living
room
shoot
it
down
worst
case
scenario
you
end
up
in
district
court
somewhere
and
eventually
paying
out
a
settlement
military
doesn
t
care
neither
should
we
it
means
if
u
ever
wanted
to
fly
a
drone
over
the

nows

you

you

i
offer
my

as
tribute
go
watch
the
hearing
today
representative
smith
talked
about
how
drones
have
been
flying
over
the
ocean
and
even
believes
that
may
be
where
they
are
taking
off
and
landing
from
every
day
again
more
importantly
tho
it
s
confirmed
these
have
flown
over
our
coast
and
the
coast
guard
does
not
have
the
jurisdiction
to
shoot
them
down
that
was
representative
smith
s
main
goal
today
to
get
the
department
of
defense
to
green
light
local
militarys
jurisdiction
to
shoot
one
down
over
the
ocean
and
retrieve
it
so
they
should
just
let
these
unknown
aircraft
chill
up
there
with
no
repercussions
you
re
telling
me
they
can
t
follow
one
into
a

and
take
it

lots

it
s
not
a
good
idea
you
don
t
die
from
falling
bullets
you
made
that
up
google
it
a
bullet
is
too
small
and
too
light
to
kill
you
from
falling
face
the
fuckin
drone
my
neighbors
kid
doesn
t
have
leukemia
lol
you
didn
t
even
spell
kid
correctly
and
you
say
americans
need
iq
tests
and
that
scenario
you
propose
is
so
stupid
that
i
feel
bad
telling
you
how
stupid
it
is
how
many
kids
do
you
think
have
leukemia
in
nj
that
it
s
plausible
one
of
them
is
my
immediate
neighor
and
a
my
bullet
is
going
to
fall
on
them
by
the
way
the
maximum
velocity
and
weight
of
a
bullet
falling
from
the
sky
is
not
enough
to
seriously
harm
a
human
being
unless
it
directly
pierced
the
eye
but
imagine
the
chances
of
a
neighborhood
child
with
leukemia
standing
outside
close
to
me
while
i
shoot
at
a
drone
and
the
bullet
falls
to
earth
and
strikes
them
lmao
do
you
seriously
believe
yourself
you
find
out
who
owns
it
and
who
is
spying
on
you
don
t
be
such
a
coward
they
used
to
know
but
they
forgot
the
other
thing
with
drones
is
if
you
re
ever
chased
by
one
run
downhill
for
some
reason
they
can
t
do
that
is
this
about
the
easter
baskets
like
that
s
not
really
south
jersey
like
come
down
an
hour
or
more
to
the
south
and
you
ll
get
people
shooting
shotgun
isn
t
going
to
do
it
you
need
something
high
caliber
with
good
range
telescopic
camera
if
only
there
was
a
large
base
in
the
vicinity
housing
the
exact
belligerent
institution
that
invented
passive
night
vision
devices
in
the
first
place
of
the
kind
necessary
to
figure
this
out
instantly
i
was
thinking
of
some
security
based
ptz
camera
with
really
powerful
optical
zoom
with
flir
use
a
vehicle
and
search
around
the
common
areas
the
price
on
this
technology
is
lower
than
50k
but
also
can
go
over
that
price
equipment
can
be
rented
maybe
an
outline
of
the
shape
of
the
things
could
be
captured
even
in
one
or
two
frames
and
give
a
clue
about
it
we
re
looking
at
this
all
wrong
it
s
golf
courses
that
are
attracting
them
they
re
just
looking
to
get
in
a
quick
nine
and
they
re
just
doing
deep
research
on
where
to
do
it
i
was
asking
this
honestly
while
i
have
lived
in
nj
for
20
years
i
am
not
as
familiar
with
northern
nj
i
don
t
go
looking
for
critical
infrastructure
that
is
outside
of
my
wheelhouse
also
picatinny
arsenal
is
hugely
important
and
a
large
number
of
decommissioned
missile
sites
including
one
in
east
hanover
morristown
and
bedminster
is
interesting
only
because
trump
associates
often
fly
into
morristown
airport
and
then
helo
shuttle
over
to
his
golf
club
in
bedminster
aside
from
a
large
number
of
revolutionary
war
george
washington
stuff
and
the
national
guard
armory
which
doesn
t
hold
a
lot
i
don
t
think
morristown
has
much
in
the
way
of
important
stuff
lol
newark
airport
can
barely
stay
running
even
on
a
clear
sunny
day
you
definitely
don
t
need
a
fleet
of
drones
to
disrupt
flights
there
i
ve
never
seen
one
with
it
s
a
fantastic
idea
you
could
take
one
down
in
one
shot
and
we
d
know
once
and
for
all
probably
just
a
horse
it
baffles
me
that
people
are
still
in
denial
that
this
is
happening
i
have
yet
to
see
a
video
that
isn
t
just
lights
on
a
shaky
iphone
camera
the
mayors
are
screaming
for
answers
and
the
police
are
putting
their
own
resources
into
investigating
because
they
re
responding
to
their
own
constintuents
who
are
worked
up
into
a
frenzy
thats
irresponsible
to
discharge
a
firearm
into
the
air
in
nj
not
just
in
new
jersey
bird
hunters
be
like
it
is
irresponsible
and
eventually
someone
will
do
something
like
this
if
the
government
doesn
t
provide
an
actual
answer
would
you
actually
be
surprised
if
someone
did
this
it
s
irresponsible
to
shoot
down
a
potential
nefarious
drone
of
unknown
origin
sounds
more
like
a
civic
duty
so
can
t
shoot
at
it
but
can
drop
a
net
on
it
to
make
its
rotors
clog
and
drop
out
of
the
sky
got
it
wont
do
much
drones
fly
higher
than
20
yards
i
m
less
than
half
serious
but
your
response
is
straight
up
idiotic
understanding
sentence
structure
and
implications
are
pretty
difficult
in
your
neck
of
the
woods
ehh
who
s
advocating
i
said
someone
would
find
out
the
repercussions
of
shooting
one
down
real
quick
if
it
was
government
property
all
that
time
texting
and
zero
sense
shits
getting
actually
scary
now
man
that
hearing
today
was
sobering
pls
someone
make
a
super
graphic
ultra
modern
girl
cut
so
we
can
be
entertained
edit
i
did
it
but
it
s
trash
but
it
s
also
supposed
to
be
ironically
trash
here
you
go
https
imgur
com
a
sxurdjy
this
has
been
my
thoughts
exactly
it
took
a
chinese
balloon
invading
our
airspace
all
of
two
times
for
them
to
shoot
one
down
but
these
drone
sightings
have
been
going
on
for
21
days
and
they
ve
done
nothing
i
m
not
overly
worried
guest
posting
not
from
nj
but
i
can
think
of
several
major
security
events
in
the
us
that
were
simply
an
intelligence
failure
pearl
harbor
there
was
a
time
when
the
fbi
didn
t
take
al
qaeda
seriously
starting
in
early
2000
there
was
also
a
time
when
the
previous
administration
didn
t
take
covid
seriously
the
fact
that
leadership
doesn
t
care
doesn
t
fill
me
with
confidence
we
can
sit
here
and
smugly
post
all
day
and
i
m
sure
this
sub
is
absolutely
sick
of
the
drone
posts
about
how
just
because
nothing
s
been
done
yet
means
everything
is
peachy
but
incursions
over
us
airspace
shouldn
t
be
so
brushed
off
i
don
t
know
how
you
guys
are
totally
cool
with
unknown
uas
just
hovering
above
your
homes
and
no
logical
explanation
the
dod
regularly
releases
notices
that
ironically
usually
go
unnoticed
about
uas
systems
testing
but
there
s
been
none
in
this
case
what
about
drone
unknowns
you
guys
are
hurting
my
brain
the
guy
is
custody
because
the
nypd
posted
images
of
him
that
s
called
police
work
honestly
i
m
surprised
that
someone
hasn
t
taken
a
shot
at
one
of
them
yet
he
even
said
the
commanding
officer
at
the
military
base
in
lakehurst
told
him
that
he
doesn
t
have
the
authority
to
confront
the
drones
yes
the
us
government
has
laws
that
protect
american
citizens
more
than
non
american
citizens
no
gun
that
s
probably
for
the
best
funnily
enough
it
has
been
suggested
that
skeet
shooting
be
brought
back
to
popularity
for
this
reason
still
a
tough
shot
if
not
well
practiced
you
don
t
find
anything
it
crashes
on
something
or
someone
and
the
site
will
be
codorned
off
and
you
arrested
he
was
a
drone
gary
cooper
so
what
no
fuckin
ziti
as
a
piney
i
ll
take
it
expensive
equipment
still
incredibly
hard
to
get
a
good
picture
with
sufficient
detail
that
invented
passive
night
vision
devices
in
the
first
place
if
you
want
to
go
down
a
weird
rabbit
hole
look
up
the
history
of
the
us
using
night
vision
in
combat
and
what
they
reported
seeing
okay
hey
i
ve
lived
in
south
jersey
exit
3
for
about
60
years
and
it
was
only
when
my
sons
went
to
rutgers
did
i
ever
go
up
to
north
jersey
i
don
t
go
looking
for
critical
infrastructure
that
is
outside
of
my
wheelhouse
what
does
that
not
even
mean
you
didn
t
know
nj
had
train
stations
air
ports
reservoirs
refineries
jesus
christ
it
s
not
anyone
wheelhouse
to
notice
obvious
things
morristown
and
bedminster
is
interesting
only
because
trump
associates
often
fly
into
morristown
airport
and
then
helo
shuttle
over
to
his
golf
club
in
bedminster
you
know
what
i
m
coming
around
on
the
whole
drone
thing
now
they
may
be
extremely
dangerous
and
trump
should
never
come
to
new
jersey
again
because
of
the
security
risk
they
pose
safety
first
idk
maybe
it
was
a
dinosaur
you
are
too
right
i
think
it
s
safe
to
say
that
it
is
irresponsible
to
discharge
a
fire
arm
into
the
air
in
general
yeah
but
who
gives
a
fuck
about
people
not
in
new
jersey
could
you
imagine
not
living
here
absolute
batshit
people
i
m
more
surprised
it
hasn
t
already
happened
action
hero
shit
thinking
someone
can
fire
into
the
air
and
get
it
with
one
shot
way
too
difficult
to
hit
with
a
rifle
if
you
look
at
any
ukraine
war
footage
you
ll
see
the
only
chance
is
a
shotgun
at
close
range
that
isn
t
even
a
great
way
you
think
if
it
was
unknown
to
the
military
they
would
be
doing
nothing
no
it
s
unknown
to
you
random
nobody
by
design
chill
considering
that
a
huge
number
of
these
sightings
are
actually
planes
yeah
it
s
probably
a
bad
idea
to
shoot
at
them
yes
because
here
s
the
difference
if
you
just
drop
someone
s
dji
phantom
it
s
just
going
to
piss
them
off
and
little
other
actual
harm
is
done
if
the
thing
you
think
is
a
drone
is
actually
a
gulfstream
that
s
actually
10
miles
away
and
20
000
feet
higher
up
than
you
realized
also
no
harm
done
because
your
drone
with
a
towel
hanging
under
it
isn
t
going
to
get
anywhere
near
it
let
alone
bring
it
down
yes
i
totally
agree
it
felt
embarrassing
too
posting
pictures
of
a
culprit
is
literally
the
least
you
could
do
truly
not
worth
the
11
billion
per
year
they
receive
they
have
a
literal
submarine
in
their
arsenal
but
they
can
t
catch
1
guy
how
has
not
even
one
amateur
drone
pilot
thought
you
know
what
fuck
it
i
m
gonna
send
my
drone
up
to
see
what
these
things
are
comoletely
agreed
in
theory
it
could
ve
happened
and
we
just
didn
t
find
out
about
it
but
that
s
a
bit
too
tin
foily
for
me
to
be
giving
serious
thought
at
the
moment
enough
of
that
going
around
as
is
lmao
yup
exactly
hence
why
he
directly
called
out
the
dod
to
grant
permission
for
our
local
i
believe
militias
to
shoot
one
down
imo
the
dod
will
just
keep
dodging
directly
answering
any
questions
until
this
goes
away
or
escalates
to
the
poini
where
they
cant
continue
to
ignore
it
i
m
personally
convinced
they
at
least
have
an
idea
of
what
these
may
be
and
there
is
a
reason
why
they
aren
t
informing
the
public
what
that
idea
and
reason
might
be
well
your
guess
is
as
good
as
mine
i
really
just
don
t
know
yeah
you
have
drones
flying
over
your
neighborhood
every
night
the
fbi
the
governor
local
officials
all
say
they
don
t
know
who
it
is
which
means
it
s
not
an
american
agency
company
or
civilian
and
people
like
you
sit
around
cowering
in
your
homes
and
checking
the
news
about
what
to
do
and
what
to
think
how
about
you
wake
up
have
courage
and
stand
for
something
or
shut
the
fuck
up
while
the
strong
people
do
something
and
keep
your
weak
ass
out
of
the
way
go
play
pok
mon
people
like
you
are
cowards
you
stand
in
line
at
target
and
wait
to
be
told
what
to
do
next
never
taking
life
by
the
balls
never
making
your
our
decisions
it
s
sad
be
a
leader
have
courage
no
but
he
killed
sixteen
czechoslovakians
the
guy
was
a
drone
designer
you
never
had
the
makings
of
a
varsity
drone
spotter
small
eyes
well
then
wait
and
watch
what
happens
next
whatever
it
is
doesn
t
want
you
to
have
a
clear
look
at
it
i
was
thinking
this
is
some
secret
government
project
but
now
i
think
this
is
not
being
controlled
by
the
dod
new
brunswick
rutgers
is
central
jersey
yeah
but
i
got
that
dog
in
me
i
mean
and
by
no
means
am
i
advocating
anyone
do
this
bird
shot
does
exist
that
s
why
you
use
a
shotgun
not
a
rifle
the
guy
was
caught
i
watched
a
local
news
interview
with
a
guy
who
said
he
did
just
that
but
his
drone
was
shut
down
when
it
got
close
probably
same
reason
they
don
t
want
details
of
murder
crime
scenes
leaked
sometimes
or
they
don
t
share
all
the
info
they
have
best
to
leave
your
target
in
the
dark
on
how
close
you
are
on
their
heels
because
if
they
know
someone
is
onto
them
that
gives
them
a
chance
to
get
away
why
would
i
be
cowering
in
my
home
i
m
not
afraid
of
airplanes
and
every
time
you
strong
anti
drone
freedom
fighters
tell
me
they
re
out
there
go
look
they
apparently
all
mysteriously
disappear
because
all
i
ever
see
is
normal
air
traffic
stars
satellites
and
the
perennial
favorite
unidentified
flying
object
the
planet
venus
calm
down
and
try
decaf
dork
you
re
not
protecting
me
from
jack
shit
you
re
weak
you
re
outta
control
and
you
ve
become
an
embarrassment
to
yourself
and
everybody
else
yeah
cause
the
government
hates
you
so
much
stop
dreading
lies
and
panic
in
pennsylvania
by
a
different
task
force
lol
and
they
wouldn
t
have
caught
him
if
some
random
bozo
at
a
mcdonalds
didn
t
id
him
that
s
not
police
work
that
d
be
like
in
a
group
project
1
guy
thinks
up
the
title
3
other
people
do
all
the
work
and
the
first
guy
gets
all
the
credit
or
to
test
a
widespread
real
time
surveyor
network
that
costs
a
fraction
of
satellites
the
amount
of
denial
screams
that
theyre
testing
tech
that
encroaches
on
the
privacy
of
millions
of
americans
and
the
can
t
admit
that
because
they
would
be
facing
a
shitshow
of
backlash
i
have
a
photography
drone
lol
you
are
a
sheep
what
lies
have
i
said
it
is
the
best
case
scenario
this
being
some
sort
of
defence
project
is
way
better
it
being
something
hostile
and
capable
of
inflicting
damage
hobbyist
drones
have
already
been
ruled
out
are
you
insinuating
that
these
are
adversarial
drones
isn
t
that
even
worse
8
million
people
live
in
nyc
and
millions
more
move
in
and
out
constantly
finding
a
single
person
is
a
little
tricky
a
foreign
national
involvement
scenario
isnt
possible
with
todays
tech
if
there
was
a
suv
sized
drone
flying
into
us
airspace
form
china
for
example
not
only
would
it
not
have
long
enough
range
but
it
would
also
have
been
detected
by
hundreds
of
radars
and
defense
systems
ever
seen
those
events
where
a
russian
bomber
flew
in
and
had
an
f
18
on
his
ass
in
less
than
10
minutes
which
is
why
the
possibility
that
this
is
something
sort
of
covert
military
project
seems
rather
high
in
any
case
these
drones
are
not
being
hostile
so
no
point
in
panicking
there
is
an
extremely
low
possibility
of
this
being
some
sort
of
nhi
activity
in
which
case
we
don
t
what
we
dealing
with
however
that
s
maybe
like
0
05
percent
probability
have
you
ever
heard
of
submarines
i
was
in
last
night
and
i
take
14b
to
get
on
and
off
78
to
get
to
where
i
was
and
usually
the
big
ramp
to
take
me
to
the
tolls
from
garfield
ave
and
bayway
or
maybe
i
just
don
t
remember
the
names
of
the
streets
gives
me
a
perfect
view
of
downtown
nyc
s
bright
skyline
and
i
couldn
t
see
a
thing
it
was
just
darkness
going
over
the
newark
bay
bridge
was
much
of
the
same
halfway
to
the
top
there
was
nothing
behind
me
and
i
couldn
t
even
see
the
structure
of
the
bridge
in
front
of
me
let
alone
of
course
the
cranes
at
the
port
something
eerie
about
going
over
the
bridge
and
seeing
nothing
so
basically
the
taxpayers
are
ponying
up
money
for
their
new
stadium
and
they
just
brought
in
more
billionaires
to
own
the
team
who
could
have
funded
the
stadium
instead
of
us
fuck
this
corrupted
state
government
it
s
just
that
station
i
just
googled
it
and
all
of
the
reviews
are
complaining
about
the
prices
there
being
2
more
than
everyone
else
there
is
no
way
this
is
current
unless
it
s
at
a
marina
i
just
paid
2
97
one
county
north
these
are
not
even
close
to
representative
of
the
area
it
is
3
gallon
on
long
island
now
6
must
be
an
outlier
of
sorts
i
m
in
rochester
ny
and
those
prices
are
insane
gas
station
like
2
minutes
from
my
house
is
2
99
gal
this
place
the
one
a
little
up
the
road
have
always
had
insane
prices
since
like
20
years
ago
its
literally
just
for
rich
people
who
dont
want
to
go
3m
out
of
their
way
its
been
1
50
2
50
above
anywhere
else
this
is
a
it
beats
pushing
price
but
otherwise
some
people
are
price
insensitive
i
live
in
the
area
and
its
under
3
gallon
mobile
is
notably
the
more
expensive
option
here
but
not
that
much
more
expensive
it
s
like
3
3
50
everywhere
in
nyc
there
s
no
way
this
is
real
3
59
in
western
ny
tish
james
will
sue
them
for
price
gouging
and
close
them
down
soon
enough
bullshit
though
anyone
on
this
sub
who
buys
gas
knows
this
is
a
single
station
price
99
99
of
stations
are
a
couple
bucks
cheaper
than
this
thanks
a
lot
obama
if
you
live
anywhere
near
the
area
you
occasionally
drive
past
this
mobil
and
the
bedford
shell
station
at
172
22
just
to
marvel
at
their
audacity
basically
i
m
in
the
white
plains
scarsdale
hartsdale
area
and
there
s
2
stations
in
scarsdale
that
charge
2
more
than
all
the
other
stations
in
the
area
because
they
re
isolated
it
s
all
about
location
there
s
a
place
like
this
near
the
airport
in
orlando
fl
that
charges
2
3
above
the
normal
price
they
re
fucking
scumbags
and
they
know
people
are
on
the
way
to
the
airport
and
just
stop
at
the
last
gas
station
to
refuel
their
rental
car
and
aren
t
paying
attention
they
were
getting
fined
like
1
000
day
by
the
city
at
one
point
because
they
didn
t
even
have
a
sign
with
the
prices
on
it
so
they
put
a
sign
up
on
the
side
of
the
place
behind
a
bush
so
many
people
dispute
it
with
their
credit
card
that
if
i
use
my
corporate
card
in
that
zip
code
it
gets
locked
and
i
have
to
call
them
yup
and
there
s
another
station
on
the
other
side
gk
the
street
with
the
same
prices
i
m
assuming
they
are
owned
by
the
same
guy
i
just
left
the
gas
station
in
laurelton
ny
on
my
way
to
the
airport
and
it
was
2
79
cc
2
69
cash
that
s
crazy
we
are
contracted
by
nyseg
and
are
working
from
out
of
state
we
stopped
for
breakfast
next
door
and
to
get
gas
and
i
looked
over
and
my
jaw
absolutely
hit
the
floor
in
shock
at
these
prices
i
was
flying
out
of
an
airport
one
time
and
swung
into
the
last
gas
station
before
the
airport
somewhere
in
the
south
i
don
t
remember
only
way
out
was
to
go
around
thru
the
airport
and
back
out
to
the
road
damn
if
they
didn
t
do
this
no
road
sign
prices
no
pump
placards
only
the
tiny
lcd
above
each
grade
of
gas
fucking
predatory
i
called
the
state
department
of
weights
and
measures
and
reported
them
for
not
enough
gas
i
don
t
know
if
it
did
anything
but
i
know
they
always
are
a
hassle
when
they
do
come
i
mean
you
can
drive
about
1
5
miles
to
save
2
a
gallon
each
fill
up
could
save
you
40
lol
that
s
wild
it
s
to
catch
people
fueling
up
before
returning
rental
cars
it
amazes
me
that
people
still
fill
up
there
this
particular
shell
station
is
on
the
way
to
the
hutch
and
the
only
station
in
that
direction
for
at
least
2
3
miles
it
s
wild
something
funny
about
hochul
deciding
to
do
this
in
the
most
fucking
expensive
grocery
chain
in
the
capital
region
hochul
is
feeling
the
pressure
of
low
ratings
so
sit
back
and
wait
for
your
bribe
to
arrive
in
q1
of
25
this
is
a
good
thing
are
the
state
workers
going
to
have
to
negotiate
this
into
the
contract
because
they
last
time
they
passed
paid
family
leave
for
all
new
yorkers
it
didn
t
apply
to
civil
servants
the
first
as
in
no
other
states
already
have
this
the
amount
of
people
in
this
thread
reading
prenatal
leave
leave
during
pregnancy
as
parental
leave
leave
for
new
parents
is
really
astounding
i
m
sure
it
will
only
be
mandatory
for
private
business
not
state
or
county
governments
i
love
living
in
ny
that
s
good
it
still
blows
my
mind
that
this
doesn
t
apply
to
state
workers
as
well
but
super
freaking
pumped
for
this
big
day
for
english
teachers
okay
so
hochul
stopped
puppy
mills
and
now
this
if
she
keeps
this
up
people
will
like
her
more
love
it
pre
natal
while
pregnant
not
parental
leave
for
either
parent
after
birth
adoption
we
ve
had
paid
parental
leave
since
2018
19
sometime
around
there
i
got
it
only
for
my
last
kid
but
this
is
new
pregnancy
requires
a
lot
of
appointments
especially
if
you
are
high
risk
i
ve
had
to
decide
whether
to
skip
a
prenatal
appointment
because
of
not
being
approved
for
the
day
off
unpaid
and
couldn
t
afford
to
lose
the
money
while
saving
for
a
baby
it
s
a
heartbreaking
and
potentially
harmful
situation
for
pregnant
women
to
be
in
this
is
life
changing
boom
now
move
to
texas
and
die
in
a
hospital
parking
lot
what
a
wonderful
thing
here
comes
trump
christ
america
is
such
a
third
world
country
glad
this
is
happening
but
generous
parental
rights
and
benefits
have
been
pretty
much
the
standard
for
a
long
time
in
every
other
developed
country
we
are
so
far
behind
other
countries
in
so
many
ways
it
really
is
inhumane
good
ol
kick
back
kathy
grabbing
the
headlines
next
time
we
say
all
make
sure
you
include
your
public
servants
great
news
hochul
helping
parents
rather
than
the
trump
vance
response
of
forcing
women
to
have
birth
no
matter
the
cost
to
their
lives
even
maga
women
are
still
going
to
be
against
this
now
they
just
need
to
decriminalize
sex
work
here
we
come
great
news
out
of
the
usual
shitshow
that
is
albany
you
mean
actually
supporting
birth
this
type
of
policy
is
going
to
actually
increase
birth
rates
republicans
will
hate
it
and
call
it
socialism
even
as
it
succeeds
better
at
reviving
birth
rates
than
anything
they
do
colorado
already
does
this
this
really
good
i
love
my
state
that
baby
looks
like
he
got
one
of
fifty
black
slicked
back
hair
wigs
do
you
know
when
you
hate
someone
so
bad
that
no
matter
what
they
say
even
if
it
s
a
nice
thing
you
get
mad
that
how
i
feel
about
kathy
lol
this
is
good
though
and
i
hope
other
states
follow
i
m
not
necessarily
against
it
but
is
the
government
requiring
companies
to
foot
the
bill
it
isn
t
their
money
or
is
the
state
paying
for
this
leave
its
a
good
thing
but
another
reason
why
companies
are
leaving
ny
state
rare
hochul
w
more
money
we
don
t
have
she
is
a
clown
pa
has
done
this
for
awhile
i
think
but
congrats
ny
kathy
hochul
putting
up
a
lot
of
ws
recently
she
knows
she
s
a
year
away
from
election
season
not
for
the
1
employer
in
the
state
though
it
s
for
those
awful
private
companies
not
for
the
state
employees
what
do
the
state
employees
get
again
this
is
amazing
i
had
a
baby
in
february
of
this
year
and
had
a
very
high
risk
pregnancy
my
last
couple
of
months
i
had
14
appointments
each
month
between
nst
s
ultrasounds
endocrinology
and
mfm
luckily
i
had
a
job
where
i
only
worked
weekends
but
it
really
got
me
thinking
about
how
other
women
who
work
monday
friday
would
have
been
able
to
make
those
appointments
there
was
no
chance
they
would
have
been
able
to
make
it
happen
awesome
prenatal
appointments
happen
once
a
month
for
the
first
3
months
of
pregnancy
then
2
3x
per
month
after
pto
goes
quick
if
we
have
to
use
that
the
whole
pregnancy
also
doctors
usually
are
only
available
m
f
during
business
hours
if
they
even
have
appointments
available
this
is
how
you
increase
birth
rate
if
as
a
society
you
drive
a
wedge
between
a
person
s
livelihood
and
having
children
it
s
an
obvious
result
that
people
will
choose
to
have
children
far
less
often
good
my
wife
s
contract
was
terminated
after
she
gave
notice
of
her
pregnancy
the
dummies
put
it
in
email
and
an
hr
lady
who
was
leaving
forwarded
it
to
my
wife
is
the
us
dipping
its
toe
into
joining
the
rest
of
the
developed
world
heavy
doubt
but
we
ll
see
idk
but
this
doesn
t
sound
legal
given
it
only
benefits
women
as
a
european
german
that
moved
to
ny
its
quite
shocking
to
read
they
are
the
first
state
and
its
only
happening
now
and
its
still
not
nearly
enough
maternity
leave
care
sucks
across
the
us
even
in
the
bluest
states
some
states
are
just
much
worse
than
others
is
this
hochule
just
trying
to
distract
the
voters
do
dad
s
get
leave
also
the
kid
seems
pretty
happy
about
it
she
just
kidnap
some
child
for
this
photo
op
good
move
and
now
healthcare
for
all
new
yorkers
great
but
weak
corporations
are
still
making
billion
and
we
re
asking
working
families
to
pay
more
taxes
to
fund
this
why
are
the
working
class
subsidizing
businesses
business
can
be
taxed
instead
of
working
class
to
fund
this
kathy
hokul
is
disgusting
filth
this
is
a
great
thing
i
guess
now
that
the
democrats
got
trounced
nationally
those
back
door
save
this
for
when
we
need
good
publicity
ideas
are
starting
to
work
themselves
out
of
the
back
rooms
what
about
trans
women
making
it
easier
for
working
families
how
about
not
taxing
us
working
families
so
much
that
d
help
how
about
a
free
car
you
selfish
bitc
again
another
blue
state
w
fuck
hochul
great
another
reason
for
nys
taxes
to
go
up
hopefully
this
applies
to
teachers
too
since
we
already
don
t
get
fmla
is
this
for
both
parents
awesome
now
give
everyone
access
to
gas
stoves
if
they
choose
who
is
paying
how
about
a
paid
sabbatical
why
do
i
have
to
have
a
kid
to
have
these
benefits
all
people
should
be
entitled
to
a
leave
regardless
and
have
job
to
come
back
to
new
york
is
a
great
state
for
families
i
fuckin
love
my
state
paid
by
everyone
with
a
car
so
from
what
i
understand
what
this
actually
means
is
that
pregnant
women
can
occasionally
get
a
day
off
for
medical
checkups
as
opposed
to
trying
to
find
a
time
around
work
or
taking
pto
if
needed
like
they
normally
do
i
guess
that
s
a
good
thing
definitely
less
exciting
than
how
this
announcement
is
making
it
sound
its
like
being
down
a
million
points
in
a
game
and
finally
scoring
one
point
so
they
can
have
pto
for
a
doctors
appointment
this
is
just
saying
that
you
re
doing
something
that
is
already
a
thing
but
adding
a
new
label
to
make
it
seem
like
your
doing
something
new
and
that
is
how
ny
politics
works
deleted
its
like
being
down
a
million
points
in
a
game
and
finally
scoring
one
point
massachusetts
already
does
this
why
did
the
democrats
run
on
fascism
rather
than
common
sense
policies
like
this
maybe
because
the
chance
they
got
a
full
government
was
slim
but
still
in
other
words
sick
time
and
the
people
will
pay
for
it
more
taxation
without
representation
get
rid
of
nightmare
hochul
way
overboard
you
don
t
need
to
take
leave
to
go
to
a
doctors
appointment
i
think
this
is
a
good
thing
a
potential
side
effect
is
that
companies
will
hire
men
over
women
any
business
would
look
at
this
as
an
extra
cost
to
hire
women
okay
this
is
a
real
pro
life
policy
i
get
how
this
is
a
good
thing
for
people
and
has
little
to
no
impact
on
large
businesses
who
can
take
the
hit
however
for
smaller
businesses
this
is
a
cost
that
is
incredibly
difficult
to
absorb
i
would
like
to
know
how
this
impacts
small
company
owners
but
as
a
small
business
owner
i
couldn
t
imagine
having
to
pay
for
an
employee
that
is
out
for
months
at
a
time
we
would
go
under
pregnant
people
all
ot
took
was
one
ceo
i
wonder
really
why
should
taxpayers
pay
for
a
person
s
decision
to
get
pregnant
they
shouldn
t
reddit
did
this
same
shit
with
walz
omg
a
demo
governor
did
a
good
thing
plaster
it
all
over
timelines
to
spread
the
word
nice
funded
by
all
those
people
without
children
i
m
glad
this
happened
but
ny
is
definitely
not
the
first
state
with
paid
parental
leave
i
know
that
california
washington
and
minnesota
have
had
it
for
years
already
remember
when
she
made
kids
wear
masks
for
no
reason
kathy
sucks
oh
yeah
because
women
can
t
take
time
off
pto
to
do
this
already
lol
nonissue
just
to
keep
this
stuff
in
the
headlines
that
s
such
a
new
york
liberal
thing
to
focus
use
the
charade
of
laws
to
act
like
you
re
doing
something
that
s
already
allowed
what
if
i
m
transitioning
and
identify
as
a
pregnant
woman
can
i
get
the
time
off
politicians
only
do
this
because
they
get
tax
dollars
if
we
get
paid
deleted
how
about
leave
for
a
necessary
abortion
will
this
apply
to
women
currently
on
maternity
leave
my
wife
s
a
public
school
teacher
and
has
just
run
out
of
sick
days
so
she
isn
t
getting
paid
great
more
benefits
for
women
while
real
marginalized
communities
are
left
to
rot
and
forced
to
the
back
of
the
line
and
democrats
wonder
how
they
lost
last
month
how
about
lifting
everyone
up
and
stop
hitching
your
entire
campaign
to
the
plight
of
women
and
women
alone
the
disability
community
would
like
a
word
with
government
officials
isn
t
that
sexual
discrimination
what
about
the
man
someone
get
that
kid
off
her
lap
she
s
going
to
drip
botox
and
lipstick
all
over
its
head
huh
several
states
have
parental
leave
sick
time
laws
most
of
the
time
sick
days
are
also
considered
for
family
things
this
is
good
for
sure
but
it
s
a
stretch
to
call
it
the
first
colorado
has
paid
parental
leave
just
another
excuse
to
not
hire
women
this
isn
t
new
i
got
paid
leave
two
years
ago
as
a
father
it
s
2
3
of
your
weekly
salary
up
to
1150
per
week
for
12
weeks
which
is
taxed
so
basically
if
you
earn
more
than
60k
per
year
you
hit
the
cap
plus

this
release
makes
it
sound
like
people
won
t
have
any
interruption
or
reduction
in
salary
or
benefits
that
s
not
true

what
what
is

a
great

what

result
xy
chromosome
males
increasingly
identify
as
pregnant
women
to

who
is
going

pay
for
this
employers
may
be
reluctant
to
higher
women
of
child
bearing

do
prostate
and
breast
exams
next
i
mean
ca
requires
five
days
of
paid
sick
leave
and
prenatal
appointments
def
count
still
a
good
thing
but
ca
needs
love
should
be
standard
nationwide
it
is
but
nj
already
offers
this
and
has
for
15
years
i
m
wondering
why
they
re
saying
ny
is
first
in
this
day
and
age
it
should
be
universal
this
is
a
good
thing
the
way
the
funds
are
raised
is
ridiculous
yet
again
and
this
is
because
politicians
are
too
damn
spineless
to
do
anything
about
it
the
working
class
is
subsidizing
businesses
being
assholes
the
max
tax
for
this
is
under
360
yr
but
why
are
we
asking
this
of
people
instead
of
companies
surely
we
can
mandate
this
tax
on
every
business
in
the
state
guess
not
it
looks
like

frequently
asked
questions
who
is
covered
by
the
paid

leave
law
all
employees
working
for
private
sector
employers
private

include
persons

limited

companies

associations
employing
any
individual
in

industry
trade

regardless
of
part

status
and

exempt

yup
i
m
a
county
employee
and
we
got
the
shaft
we
didn
t
opt
in
to
the
paid
family
leave
program
and
this
looks
like
another
law
that
is
just
geared
towards
private
employers
i
m
so
glad
nys
will
have
this
law
as
it
will
allow
for
pregnant
women
to
get
the
medical
care
they
need
but
it
would
be
great
if
it
could
apply
to
all
new
yorkers
and
not
just
those
who
work
in
the
private
sector
that
was
so
hilarious
cos
my
friend
had
a
baby
and
worked
for
the
state
couldn
t
use
it
it
was
such
an
l
to
not
apply
it
to
actual
state
and
city
employees
it
s
like
saying
mmmm
we
value
employees
but
not
our
employees
because
they
don
t
consider
civil
servants
to
be
employees
they
see
us
as
clowns
i
mean
agents
or
whatever
made
up
term
they
had
to
not
include
us
unions
won
t
support
it
because
it
harms
the

state
won
t
support
it
because
it
harms
the
state
bypassing
this
the
state
can
say
hey
look
we
support
workers
but
really
it
s
just
we
support
workers
because
it
costs
the
corporations
money
and
productivity
but
doesn
t
cost
the
state
anything
yes
the
law
is
directed
at
private
employers
because
they
lag
significantly
behind
public
employers
in
providing
paid
time
off
the
argument
is
that
nys
workers
already
receive
enough
pto
to
attend
pre

appointments

i
seriously
doubt
any
of
them
would
can
you
name
one
to
think
ny
isn
t
the
first
that
was
my
thought
but
then
i
realized
prenatal
has
the
same
letters
as
parental
and
i
was
misreading
the
title
california

since
the

what
s
even
more
astounding
is
how
confident
they
sound
in
their
ignorance
honestly
i
was
in
europe
a
bunch
of
different
countries
and
coming
back
i
was
really
upset
at
how
bad
we
have
it
in

in

to
social
programs
but
sometimes
reddit
randomly
shows
me
stuff
from
the

which
makes
me
go
jfc
atleast
we
re
not
that
bad
same
it
s
a
beautiful
state
and
living
in
pennsylvania
for
college
made
me
miss
it
so
much
i
like
it
while
i
m
not
shoveling
but
while
shoveling
fuck
this
state
it
s
too
bad
a
lot

don
t
this

raw
numbers
in

you
love

too
take
a
look
at

instead
of

it

moving

because

this
that
s
what

all
about
it
s
already

though
lol
hey
hey
the
richest
third
world
country
what
country
are
you
from
no
we
are
a
first
world
nation
that
treats
its
people
like
shit
at
least
third
world
governments
are
dependent
on
someone
else
so
they
have
an
excuse
i
wish
more
americans
would
get
to
travel
and
live
for
a
bit
in
other
countries
there
are
places
where
it
is
illegal
for
your
employer
to
contact
you
in
your
off
hours
you
get
5
weeks
of
vacation
mandatory
parental
leave
few
weeks
of
sick
days
and
if
you
get
really
sick
you
get
a
year
of
75
pay
and
can
be
extended
not
to
mention
universal
healthcare
and
you
can
t
be
fired
on
the
spot
and
so
many
other
things
like
healthy
food
good
protections
etc
etc
americans
have
been
indoctrinated
that
this
will
destroy
the
business
but
if
you
see
how
those
cities
businesses
and
people
are
living
they
are
thriving
they
have
nicer
cities
they
are
happier
they
travel
on
vacations
more
often
it
s
fucking
depressing
coming
back
to
us
everyone
tours
how
great
this
country
is
cause
the
economy
is
good
for
the
few
rich
folks
while
the
vast
majority
of
the
population
struggles
to
survive
we
have
the
best
economy
with
the
most
billionaires
but
how
does
that
help
the
average
folk
if
seen
happier
people
in
bumfuck
nowhere
eu
than
in
ritch
metropolis
like
dallas
i
just
passed
thru
dallas
stopped
off
i
20
and
it
s
like
nowhere
i
ve
seen
zombie
people
in
walmarts
and
just
desolation
everywhere
you
look
at
those
people
it
s
such
a
sad
state
of
affairs
but
yeah
we
are
such
a
fucking
prosperous
nation
yup
this
law
means
shit
to
me
as
a
public
school
employee
glad
everyone
else
gets
the
benefits
while
i
get
nothing
and
have
to
hurry
back
to
take
care
of
everyone
else
s
child
but
my
own
oh
fuck
that
im
from
the
seneca
nation
she
is
no
friend
of
ours
so
kicking
it
back
to
the
states
to
decide
abortion
forcing
women
to
have
babies
lol
this
is
why
you
lost
doubt
it
this
seems
like
a
bipartisan
thing
people
want
but
distracted
from
doing
anything
for
it
no
they
won
t
dumby
lol
i
m
all
for
it
but
it
s
not
high
on
my
priority
list
and
certainly
doesn
t
move
the
needle
on
my
voting
it
s
called
tinder
bro
just
go
to
a
bar
studies
show
that
decriminalizing
sex
work
or
even
legalizing
it
doesnt
actually
decrease
human
trafficking
in
those
areas
but
unionized
sex
workers
on
the
other
hand
as
has
been
pointed
out
repeatedly
this
is
not
maternity
or
paternity
leave
this
is
prenatal
leave
tell
your
senator
and
assembly
member
to
ignore
these
people
https
cseany
org
stopnyha
it
s
happening
because
people
like
it
when
billionaires
exploit
them
and
want
more
of
that
case
and
point
2024
presidential
election
prenatal
leave
implies
capability
of
pregnancy
it
s
not
about
parental
leave
it
s
prenatal
leave
so
it
s
for
the
parent
they
gets
pregnant
ya
it
s
a
bit
ridiculous
it
s
the
first
state
in
the
usa
so
by
definition
it
is
a
big
thing
it
s
a
great
thing
prenatal
appointments
happen
once
a
month
for
the
first
3
months
of
pregnancy
then
2
3x
per
month
after
pto
goes
quick
if
we
have
to
use
that
the
whole
pregnancy
also
doctors
usually
are
only
available
m
f
during
business
hours
if
they
even
have
appointments
available
as
opposed
to
men
that
have
to
take
pto
for
a
doctors
visit
does
it
extend
to
their
partners
though
no
it
is
an
addition
to
the
current
sick
leave
the
additional
paid
off
is
only
for
those
who
are
pregnant
it
offers
at
least
20
more
hours
of
this
time
on
top
of
the
sick
time
they
are
not
just
relabeling
the
sick
leave
policy
i
m
not
sure
why
this
is
such
a
complex
thing
to
understand
for
some
this
law
makes
it
so
you
don
t
have
to
blow
through
your
sick
time
to
attend
appointments
based
on
how
far
along
you
are
in
your
pregnancy
your
ob
visits
go
from
being
monthly
to
bimonthly
to
weekly
starting
at
30
weeks
i
had
to
attend
appointments
3
times
a
week
nailed
it
worked
in
the
legislature
for
almost
10
years
that
s
exactly
what
so
many
on
both
sides
try
to
do
i
think
prenatal
leave
is
different
than
paternity
leave
paternal
leave
is
for
the
father
post
birth
prenatal
leave
is
for
the
pregnant
mother
it
s
a
state
law
governing
employer
time
off
policies
where
are
the
taxes
coming
in
exactly
like
so
many
of
you
you
have
no
clue
what
tf
you
re
talking
about
and
you
just
parrot
whatever
mindless
bs
has
been
programmed
into
you
absolute
lemming
would
you
have
preferred
if
nobody
knew
about
this
so
you
could
keep
yapping
about
how
democrats
never
do
anything
as
many
others
have
pointed
out
this
is
prenatal
leave
not
parental
leave
take
wins
where
you
can
get
them
she
may
suck
but
this
isn
t
one
of
those
occasions
tone
deaf
why
genuinely
curious
why
should
women
have
to
use
their
personal
pto
for
prenatal
care
if
you
re
against
women
having
a
separate
law
giving
them
extra
paid
time
off
for
prenatal
care
then
you
don
t
care
about
women
or
children
this
is
about
prenatal
leave
not
parental
leave
would
be
under
sick
leave
are
we
talking
about
different
legistlation
this
legistlation
covers
all
women
including
ones
from
marginalized
communities
besides
financial
support
programs
for
women
are
ultimately
supported
programs
for
all
families
during
period
of
pregnancy
men
can
t
get
pregnant
if
this
what
you
think
as
a
solution
it
s
not
bueno
this
is
prenatal
leave
meaning
before
birth
you
received
parental
leave
two
different
things
you
got
prenatal
leave
as
a
father
like
others
said
it
s
prenatal
leave
pfl
is
different
that
being
said
you
can
use
your
pto
while
on
pfl
to
bring
your
pay
up
to
100
i
am
currently
on
pfl
and
receive
100
of
my
pay
due
to
using
my
pto
idk
why
i
should
oppose
this
but
let
me
quick
make
up
a
reason
to
damn
man
i
hope
it
gets
better
for
you
i
m
a
republican
and
you
sound
like
an
unhinged
troll
delete
your
profile
and
fuck
off
everyone
wants
parents
to
be
able
to
raise
their
kids
and
not
lose
their
jobs
it
s
also
for
both
moms
and
dads
if
you
read
the
damn
updates
i
don
t
like
high
wasted
tax
but
this
is
something
that
i
will
gladly
chip
in
for
try
being
more
based
and
celebrate
the
bipartisan
wins
make
families
great
again
edit
nypfl
includes
both
while
this
is
for
pregnancy
got
pissed
off
and
rushed
but
my
original
comment
still
stands
lol
not
rushing
them
back
to
work
regardless
of
whether
the
fuck
is
going
on
is
perfectly
needed
and
wanted
i
mean
nobody
is
identifying
as
pregnant
and
we
had
to
have
a
doctor
s
note
to
qualify
for
leave
after
why
do
you
think
it
will
be
any
different
gender
is
not
purely
medical
pregnancy
is
that
s
literally
already
illegal
why
stop
there
all
exams
that
d
be
great
don
t
threaten
us
with
a
good
time
there
s
trucks
medical
trailers
that
park
in
low
income
areas
with
a
few
doctors
on

that
do

my

works
as
a
public
school
teacher
and
she
gets
zero
paid
leave
other
than
using
up
whatever
sick
time
she
has
available
really
wish
hochul
would
talk
the
talk
and
get
these
benefits
for
public
sector
workers
mandating
them
for
private
businesses
is
fine
but
government
needs
to
show
leadership
on
this
front
too
with
similar
benefits
hahaha
she
literally
hates
us
that
makes
no
sense
if
i
as
a
small
business
owner
can
afford
to
pay
it
so
can
the

you
are

you
are

here
i

i
can

take
up

but
the
remaining
time
is
unpaid
and
i
d
have
to
pay
for
my
health
insurance
it
s
super
frustrating
considering
i
m
pregnant
and
will
be
taking
the
minimum
but
luckily
my
birth
is
attached
to
a
summer
break
the
only
people
in

those
who
want

or
so
have
somewhere
around
150
hours
more
people
are
using
sick
time
since
covid
and
are
trying
to
be
respectful
towards
others
by
not
coming
in
when
sick
that
150
hours
goes
fast
if
you
are
using
increments
for
doctors
visits
morning
sickness
etc
and
if
you
don
t
accrue
time
during

leave
you
can
be
in

bad
spot
when
you
get
back
and

of
hurrr
durrr
do
you
research
you
got
a
point
to
prove
fucking
prove
it
no
this
law
allows
for
a
separate
bank
of
time
specifically
for
prenatal
appointments
this
isn
t
the
same
thing
you
see
the
prefix
in
pre
natal
leave
parental
leave
is
great
but
not
useful
for
all
the
appointments
needed
before
your
new
addition
that
s
great
for
you
as
a
public
school
employee
i
got
nothing
built
in
i
m
high
risk
and
had
a
medical
emergency
the
year
before
getting
pregnant
causing
me
to
use
all
my
banked
days
the
days
i
had
this
year
were
all
used
up
by
my
dozens
of
doctors
appointments
and
i
m
not
even
in
the
third
trimester
yet
there
s
a
huge
gap
in
not
covering
state
employees
especially
public
school
employees
we
can
t
be
home
with
our
own
children
but
have
to
hurry
back
to
care
for
everyone
else
s
if
we
want
to
survive
it
s
bullshit
this
is
not
true
as
a
new
state
employee
i
got
pregnant
and
blew
through
my
sick
time
very
quickly
with
prenatal
appointments
and
at
the
time
unpaid
maternity
leave
now
3
years
later
i
am
still
struggling
to
save
sick
time
because
kids
get
sick
guaranteed
prenatal
time
not
tied
to
my
personal
sick
time
would
have
been
very
helpful
so
i
know
this
is
the
opinion
of
the
union
reps
but
it
is
not
a
fully
accurate
representation
of
those
they
represent
while
i
struggled
with
pregnancy
birth
and
the
loss
of
my
mil
and
faced
unpaid
leave
because
i
was
out
of
time
our
union
rep
told
me
i
was
lucky
to
have
sick
time
even
after
explaining
i
was
out
of
paid
sick
leave
it
left
me
completely
frustrated
and
unheard
from
our
representative
and
left
me
with
a
very
bad
impression
of
the
union
nys
has
been
raising
its
minimum
wage
every
year
for
years
as
a
business
owner
and
someone
who
has
worked
for
minimum
wage
it
does
not
improve
a
thing
for
anyone
100
people
get
a
one
dollar
raise
assuming
they
work
40
hours
each
that
is
4000
dollars
more
towards
payroll
weekly
and
that
increase
in
cost
is
reflected
immediately
in
the
cost
of
products
and
services
your
raise
in
pay
is
not
even
close
to
the
increase
in
the
cost
of
all
the
products
and
services
you
use
on
a
regular
basis
as
a
result
your
living
situation
is
worse
not
better
reducing
the
cost
of
living
is
the
solution
not
paying
people
more
just
because
inflation
is
just
a
word
that
we
throw
around
for
fun
people
get
paid
more
then
businesses
just
hire
less
nys
has
been
a
financial
failure
for
over
a
decade
and
all
they
do
is
come
up
with
stupid
was
to
charge
more
money
for
nothing
you
own
a
car
cool
pay
nys
annually
to
use
it
make
sure
you
purchase
insurance
that
most
people
never
use
wanna
use
a
bridge
thruway
or
just
drive
on
the
city
cool
pay
for
that
every
time
you
use
it
and
pay
more
to
do
so
every
year
house
pay
nys
every
year
even
if
you
own
it
out
right
and
pay
more
every
year
as
a
new
yorker
if
you
think
this
state
is
moving
in
the
right
direction
then
you
have
no
idea
what
is
really
going
on
i
m
not
sure
about
the
minimum
wage
thing
yet
from
what
i
ve
read
it
causes
layoffs
hurts
small
business
and
raises
prices
of
goods
and
rent
what
part
of
ny
if
you
don
t
mind
me
asking
welcome
almost
like
how
it
was
designed
these
people
want
unitarism
so
bad
but
love
their
states
rights
especially
in
ca
and
ny
newsome
is
trump
proofing
california
can
t
do
that
without
states
rights
pre
natal
time
separate
from
regular
sick
leave
or
pto
isn
t
currently
mandatory
parental
leave
post
birth
was
made
mandatory
a
few
years
ago
this
is
extra
mandated
leave
for
medical
care
appointments
before
birth
it
really
is
something
new
no
first
world
country
has
people
die
because
they
can
t
afford
medical
care
i
wish
more
americans
would
get
to
travel
and
live
for
a
bit
in
other
countries
there
are
places
where
it
is
illegal
for
your
employer
to
contact
you
in
your
off
hours
you
get
5
weeks
of
vacation
mandatory
parental
leave
few
weeks
of
sick
days
and
if
you
get
really
sick
you
get
a
year
of
75
pay
and
can
be
extended
not
to
mention
universal
healthcare
and
you
can
t
be
fired
on
the
spot
all
to
make
significantly
less
money
and
have
worse
healthcare
no
thanks
well
multiple
states
have
already
made
the
decision
to
ban
it
and
have
had
women
die
because
of
those
laws
kicking
it
back
wasn
t
a
thing
until
they
realized
how
badly
a
national
ban
was
impacting
their
election
chances
since
i
don
t
believe
a
woman
s
life
is
worth
less
if
they
live
in
tx
or
la
as
opposed
to
ny
it
s
allowing
exactly
what
they
described
to
happen
and
continue
happening
this
is
of
course
assuming
trump
wasn
t
lying
about
a
national
abortion
ban
and
given
the
facts
around
the
president
elect
assuming
he
wasn
t
lying
is
a
losing
bet
you
re
talking
to
a
brick
wall
libs
will
praise
hochul
and
demonize
trump
no
matter
what
let
s
not
forget
that
ny
taxes
are
massive
she
s
gone
after
natural
gas
energy
she
s
spent
many
millions
of
dollars
on
illegal
immigrants
has
signed
off
of
and
supported
insanely
weak
criminal
justice
laws
etc
there
s
so
much
wasteful
spending
in
ny
i
ve
never
had
so
many
family
and
friends
leave
than
the
past
few
years
everyone
i
know
that
s
retiring
is
leaving
for
nc
tn
etc
tinder
discriminates
against
sex
workers
paying
for
it
sets
boundaries
and
prevents
drama
you
have
that
backwards
unions
could
still
include
brothels
and
pimps
take
a
look
at
europe
or
australia
new
zealand
the
u
s
likes
to
make
it
look
like
sex
trafficking
is
more
prevalent
than
it
actually
is
but
the
u
s
is
always
obsessed
with
sex
in
an
unhealthy
way
there
s
actually
more
labor
trafficking
in
other
trades
besides
sex
but
americans
aren
t
concerned
about
that
so
much
so
a
trans
man
can
also
get
it
so
it
s
better
for
the
mom
to
be
alone
with
the
child
instead
of
having
both
parents
be
there
seems
a
bit
backwards
no
california
was
the
first
deleted
ok
i
will
make
this
succinct
so
you
understand
there
is
a
cost
to
have
a
trained
employee
take
time
away
from
work
because
she
chose
to
have
a
child
a
replacement
employee
has
to
take
up
her
workload
or
that
work
is
given
to
other
employees
who
have
chosen
not
to
take
time
off
from
work
they
are
forced
to
take
on
additional
work
and
this
inefficiency
is
reflected
in
production
output
now
there
is
usually
a
tax
incentive
given
to
employers
to
cover
the
missing
employee
thus
taxpayers
are
forced
to
provide
an
economic
basis
to
the
company
in
the
form
of
tax
credits
or
increased
prices
for
the
inefficiency
dictated
by
government
to
cover
for
that
employee
that
is
gone
there
is
no
free
lunch
that
you
have
fallen
for
as
dictated
by
a
certain
segment
of
our
society
everything
has
a
cost
and
to
have
others
pay
for
your
lack
of
responsibility
is
indicative
by
the
massive
deficits
run
by
blue
states
whose
only
hope
is
for
federal
government
to
bail
them
out
for
their
mismanagement
and
inefficiency
capuche
or
do
i
need
to
get
some
crayola
s
to
explain
in
detail
my
wife
and
children
would
heartedly
disagree
but
should
it
extend
to
the
father
also
so
he
can
attend
and
not
use
pto
how
far
do
we
go
with
this
fyi
i
attended
every
one
of
my
wife
s
doctor
s
appts
deleted
legislation
like
this
is
glass
ceiling
feminism
101
concerning
marginalized
communities
see
above
also
such
legislation
should
not
be
presented
as
a
civil
rights
issue
when
so
many
legitimate
marginalized
communities
have
never
received
a
fair
deal
who
ends
up
picking
up
the
extra
work
the
man
prenatal
parental
reading
not
anagrams
yes
i
got
about
13
000
from
the
state
insurance
program
it
s
parental
leave
not
maternal
leave
is
the
gender
pay
gap
going
to
even
up
after
this
will
employers
be
more
prone
to
hire
on
the
basis
of
gender
b
c
of
this
decisions
have
consequences
you
don
t
forsee
any
possibility
of
a
lawsuit
for
discrimination
on
the
basis
of
gender
and
misspelled
kinda
hard
to
prove
why
stop
there
just
pay
all
mother
a
universal
basic
income
i
wasn
t
being
sarcastic
i
know
i
used
to
run
one
of
those
with
no
medical
experience
they
already
do
sleeping
copulation
time
is
interesting
if
they
want
more
babies
to
power
their
future
factories
they
already
have
that
where
i
work
people
take
fmla
all
the
time
just
because
they
don
t
feel
like
going
to
work
good
for
ny
let
s
take
the
power
back
for
the
people
sour
grapes
it
s
total
bullshit
i
am
a
public
school
teacher
too
when
i
had
my
daughter
my
friends
were
like
well
you
get
the
best
paid
leave
right
i
laughed
in
their
face
i
was
like
nope
i
have
to
use
all
my
sick
days
pay
100
a
day
to
keep
my
health
insurance
til
i
get
back
then
hope
and
pray
she
or
i
doesn
t
get
sick
before
the
end
of
the
school
year
but
i
don
t
have
a
pension
same
if
we
can
foot
pfl
and
worker
s
comp
insurance
packages
so
can
nys
just
another
virtue
signal
from
hochul
without
any
real
leadership
in
sight
not
all
unions
but
as
it
applies
to
government
sector
unions
because
it
weakens
the
union
in
the
eyes
of
its
members
and
the
body
the
union
opposes
if
the
state
gives
employees
something
the
union
cannot
the
union
looks
inept
and
if
the
state
compels
the
opposing
body
to
give
it
to
employees
without
going
through
the
union
then
the
opposing
body
is
going
to
feel
like
it
lost
something
as
part
of
the
negotiation
without
getting
anything
in
return
and
will
be
less
likely
to
negotiate
favorably
with
the
union
next
negotiation
contract
cycle
do
you
have
a
link
to
the
rules
i
d
like
to
share
it
with
my
cousin
who
is
currently
pregnant
in
portland
and
has
been
taking
unpaid
time
off
for
her
prenatal
care
appointments
i
couldn
t
find
anything
when
i
looked
well
then
no
idea
bad
research
i
guess
not
the
same
thing
so
dense
ny
has
that
already
it
s
not
the
same
the
prenatal
leave
is
for
people
who
are
currently
pregnant
who
can
have
additional
time
off
to
attend
appointments
procedures
etc
it
ll
be
a
part
of
the
ny
sick
time
that
s
not
what
this
is
ny
has
pfl
as
well
i
know
you
californians
love
to
colonize
progressivism

lol
wrong
thing
bro
6
months
total
can
be
used
before
and
after
baby
first
this
isn
t
new
i
took
this
two
years
ago
second
it
s
not
a
law
that
your
employer
has
to
keep
paying
you
your
entire
salary
or
something
it
s
an
insurance
program
through
the
state
that
pays
2
3
of
your
salary
for
12
weeks
up
to
1150
per
week
max
so
to
max
out
requires
earning
100k
per
year
the
money
is
also
taxable
this
program
doesn
t
make
people
whole
again
it
s
basically
like
unemployment
insurance
just
for
12
weeks
after
giving
birth
yea
i
know
i
clarified
about
that
but
unless
you
join
nys
service
and
get
pregnant
immediately
you
should
have
enough
time
to
get
by
i
say
that
with
all
sincerity
having
one
year
of
service
should
bank
you
around
100
hours
or
so
depending
on
your
union
to
be
fair
i
m
not
talking
about
nysut
you
guys
have
a
totally
separate
bargaining
unit
than
my
union
does
perhaps
it
s
unfair
of
me
to
talk
big
about
my
union
who
i
think
does
a
good
job
on
the
whole
when
people
in
this
sub
and
comments
are
clearly
dealing
with
half
a
dozen
different
unions
that
really
sucks
no
two
ways
about
it
i
think
it
s
fair
to
say
that
while
your
experience
is
an
edge
case
i
d
love
to
know
about
the
specifics
some
time
so
that
we
can
propose
changes
to
fill
in
those
gaps
you
haven
t
named
a
single
thing
that
hasn
t
been
in
existence
for
30
years
yet
you
remain
here
and
open
a
business
here
then
write
a
paragraph
on
reddit
of
how
unfair
it
all
is
lmao
you
re
a
joke
those
things
happen
with
or
without
it
especially
with
a
ton
of
tariffs
about
to
be
imposed
it
does
all
those
things
but
reddit
cares
more
about
how
laws
make
them
feel
you
are
correct
fingerlakes
area
i
m
super
excited
single
payer
systems
have
been
showing
better
results
for
less
cost
than
the
us
since
i
was
still
in
high
school
the
claim
that
nationaly
funded
health
care
is
worse
than
what
americans
receive
is
a
lie
there
is
0
evidence
to
support
the
claim
you
re
making
so
what
you
re
saying
is
everyone
you
know
who
is
retiring
is
staying
to
make
money
where
they
can
actually
do
so
in
a
state
that
s
prosperous
and
moving
with
that
saved
money
to
a
state
that
is
cheap
because
it
lacks
the
opportunity
to
make
said
money
got
it
nailed
it
no
i
dont
think
i
do
according
to
multiple
studies
legalizing
sex
work
does
not
demonstrably
decrease
sex
trafficking
and
in
fact
some
research
suggests
it
may
even
increase
trafficking
rates
due
to
the
expansion
of
the
sex
market
making
it
harder
to
identify
victims
within
a
larger
pool
of
sex
workers

i
guess
the
idea
is
that
the
pregnancy
will
have
negative
effect
on
mothers
ability
to
work
hence
why
she
would
be
in

of
financial
assistance
i
do
think
that
it
would
be
nice
to
expand
it
to

as
well
but
be
realistic
you
think
republicans
and
business
lobbyists
would
ever
allow

all
that
to

imagine
as

try

blue

lol
you
just
can

it
huh
prenatal
care
is
very
important
why
should
women
be
forced
to
use
their
personal
pto
it
s
discriminatory
towards

women
nys
already
has
paid

fathers

you
know
what
i

gladly
hear
you
out
what
legistlation
should
the

introduce
to

the

the
idea
of

is
to
ensure
that
there
would
be
no
need
for
anyone
to
pick
up
extra
work
this
is
about
doctor
visits
during
pregnancy
not
extended
leave
we
re
talking
a
couple
hours
at
a
time
in
most
cases
that
extra
work
can
wait
until
the
person
gets
back
to
work
same
as
if
they
went
to
the
dentist
exactly
he
didn
t
reading
is
hard
huh
it
s
the
first
thing
i
thought
of
when
i
saw
this
why
stop
there
all
residents
of
the
us
get
a
universal
basic
income
i
wasn
t
either
pto
for
doctors
appointments
and
sick
time
are
already
a
thing
you
don
t
have
to
disclose
why
you
are
going
to
a
doctor
to
your
employer
and
can
use
pto
or
psl
for
the
appointment
pregnant
women
can
do
it
as
well
this
is
just
adding
a
label
to
something
so
she
can
pretend
she
is
doing
something
for
the
people
while
simultaneously
tanks
the
states
economy
in
every
other
way
nobody
is
going
to
take
paid
time
off
work
to
have
a
finger
shoved
up
their
ass
everyone
would
literally
rather
work
fmla
protects
your
job
but
is
not
paid
and
it
usually
involves
a
disease
that
may
be
invisible
to
you
like
ms
but
very
hard
on
the
person
more
like
companies
just
say
f
employing
people
in
new
york
let
s
move
a
day
they
made
you
pay
3k
a
month
my
wife
and
i
just
had
our
baby
and
she
is
a
public
school
teacher
i
work
for
a
bank
i
get
more
time
off
for
the
baby
than
she
does
it
s
fucking
wild
you
forgot
disability
and
ss
i
don
t
mind
paying
it
but
let
s
make
it
even
for
everyone
she
could
have
just
expanded
pfl
or
pto
so
the
union
should
offer
it
with
my
work
i
applied
for
the
paid
medical
leave
and
chose
intermittent
you
can
take
12
weeks
over
a
52
week
period
i
was
told
i
can
do
it
to
go
to
appointments
or
whatever
prior
to
the
baby
being
born
https

oregon

you
mean
women
who
are
currently
pregnant
right
deleted
you
are
really
pressed
about
california
lmao
chill
it
s
coming
off
as
a
bit
weird
ca
is
a
beautiful
state
and
so
is
new
york
our
county
is
better
having
the
both
of
them
admittedly
i
am
a
proud
californian
and
i
understand
your
criticism
about
neoliberalism
out
here
but
at
the
same
time
i
don
t
view
new
york
as
some
consistent
bastion
of
progressivism
either
with
hochul
as
governor
and
ex
cop
eric
fucking
adams
as
mayor
of
nyc
this
is
a
new
law
that
gives
people
paid
leave
time
to
use
for
prenatal
appointments
this
is
not
the
same
as
post
birth
paid
leave

i
said
i
read
up
on
it
you
don
t
need
to
educate
me
are
you
saying
since
it
s
not
100
of
pay
and
it
s
counted
as
taxable
income
we
should
do
away
with
the
program
it
s
not
progressive
enough
for
you
i
saw
that
the
point
is
you
shouldn
t
have
to
worry
about
getting
by
these
are
necessary
appointments
and
the
time
adds
up
very
quickly
an
hour
long
appointment
with
half
an
hour
commute
each
way
adds
up
plus
then
the
time
isn
t
available
if
someone
needs
it
when
they
get
sick
or
for
any
other
appointments
giving
people
extra
time
to
have
one
less
thing
to
worry
about
sounds
like
a
good
idea
imho
saying
this
as
a
state
worker
with
no
kids
who
doesn
t
plan
on
it
ever
because
they
re
gross
yeah
it
was
certainly
very
disheartening
when
i
called
the
union
multiple
times
and
was
told
it
wasn
t
that
big
of
an
issue
it
was
a
complete
turn
off
from
getting
involved
in
any
union
activities
because
the
compassion
and
empathy
from
the
albany
rep
was
completely
lacking
something
in
nys
has
to
change
were
hemorrhaging
population
and
were
going
to
lose
electoral
power
tax
revenue
and
businesses
yeah
i
m
not
in
favor
of
tariffs
either
those
things
are
a
direct
result
of
it
it
s
been
happening
for
years
god
that
area
is
beautiful
and
has
excellent
wine
i
grew
up
near
conesus
lake
it
s
beautiful
happy
for
you
i
hope
you
love
it
here
single
payer
systems
have
been
showing
better
results
for
less
cost
than
the
us
since
i
was
still
in
high
school
the
claim
that
nationaly
funded
health
care
is
worse
than
what
americans
receive
is
a
lie
its
not
we
have
quicker
access
better
doctors
and
better
hospitals
i
dont
care
what
it
costs
no
not
at
all
many
are
stuck
here
due
to
barely
scraping
by
and
not
having
the
means
to
move
biden
exacerbated
the
issue
nationally
as
for
people
soon
to
retire
they
re
so
close
to
retirement
or
were
until
retirement
it
d
be
stupid
to
leave
then
take
their
pensions
and
retirement
accounts
and
move
to
a
place
where
you
aren
t
regulated
and
taxed
into
oblivion
all
your
doing
is
proving
my
point
legalizing
vs
decriminalizing
are
2
very
different
things
yes
i
do
part
of
the
republican
platform
is
bringing
back
the
nuclear
family
having
both
parents
around
would
be
the
most
beneficial
move
for
everyone
ok
you
like
ostriches
cause
you
sure
act
like
one
with
your
head
in
sand
and
azz
up
in
air
but
then
you
all
are
alike
discriminatory
that
could
apply
to
any
medical
need
or
issue
that
applies
solely
to
one
sex
legislation
increasing
the
amount
a
disabled
person
can
make
while
still
being
eligible
for
federal
state
insurance
medicaid
continuing
to
raise
the
minimum
wage
and
supporting
workers
rights
to
vote
for
their
best
interests
babies
born
with
severe
illnesses
and
such
automatically
being
placed
on
medicaid
reparations
in
the
form
of
free
college
and
zero
interest
loans
for
homes
and
businesses
is
that
enough
i
could
go
on
somebody
at
the
place
of
business
will
be
picking
up
the
extra
work
d
a
m
mothers
against
dyslexia
why
stop
there
any
global
citizen
who
can
cross
our
border
into
the
usa
gets
a
universal
basic
income
well
this
is
adding
extra
time
for
pregnant
women
specifically
bc
they
typically
need
more
doctor
s
appointments
than
the
average
person
and
might
run
out
of
hours
if
they
only
had
their
normal
pto
psl
to
pull
from
i
m
not
a
fan
of
hers
either
but
this
law
is
definitely
doing
something
agree
or
disagree
with
it
except
pto
isn
t
guaranteed
and
many
jobs
don
t
offer
much
of
it
and
pregnant
women
require
many
more
appointments
in
their
9
months
than
the
average
person
so
this
is
great
all
around
i
can
t
for
the
life
of
me
understand
why
people
are
against
making
things
easier
for
pregnant
women
to
help
ensure
the
health
of
the
fetus
i
m
about
in
my
third
trimester
and
high
risk
i
will
now
have
an
appointment
once
a
week
until
i
deliver
twice
a
week
when
i
get
to
the
last
month
and
the
hospital
high
risk
office
is
only
open
from
9
3
i
have
to
take
off
to
go
to
these
appointments
i
also
have
other
medical
conditions
necessitating
medical
appointments
hence
being
high
risk
my
job
does
not
qualify
for
paid
parental
leave
school
employee
i
can
save
up
my
sick
days
for
paid
parental
leave
except
i
have
none
because
i
have
so
many
appointments
before
even
giving
birth
i
get
fmla
i
guess
which
doesn
t
mean
much
to
me
because
i
m
on
my
husbands
insurance
benefits
nys
has
5
minimum
sick
days
per
year
pregnant
women
have
alot
more
than
5
doctors
appointments
in
9
months
why
do
you
hate
pregnant
women
people
might
take
advantage
of
this
thing
so
we
should
withhold
it
from
the
people
who
actually
need
it
that
s
how
you
sound
just
wait
until
you
re
peeing
18
times
a
day
and
when
you
go
and
you
constantly
feel
like
you
have
to
go
it
s
just
drips
or
a
slow
dribble
and
you
never
seem
to
be
able
to
finish
peeing
it
gets
even
better
once
there
starts
to
be
blood
in
your
urine
and
your
semen
i
hear
the
bone
pain
is
pretty
fun
too
1
in
8
men
will
be
diagnosed
with
prostate
cancer
in
their
lifetimes
they
can
catch
it
pretty
early
even
before
symptoms
if
you
get
your
yearly
physical
and
it
s
pretty
easily
treated
at
that
stage
otherwise
there
s
always
the
chance
it
will
metastasize
and
go
anywhere
and
everywhere
then
you
re
well
and
truly
fucked
i
think
it
s
worth
a
finger
up
the
ass
for
15
seconds
once
a
year
to
prevent
a
horrible
death
i
ve
personally
never
had
one
done
but
i
d
like
to
think
if
i
got
to
the
age
or
for
another
reason
and
needed
a
finger
up
the
ass
i
would
probably
take
the
day
not
give
a
shit
telling
my
boss
that
it
s
for
a
prostate
exam
my
jobs
tend
to
fuck
me
up
the
ass
harder
than
a
doctor
s
finger
ever
would
nobody
is
going
to
take
a
day
off
work
to
not
die
do
you
think
not
everyone
peep
my
username
lol
if
you
apply
to
care
for
a
family
member
it
is
paid
fmla
covers
a
lot
more
than
that
yeah
lol
good
luck
finding
talent
if
i
wanted
to
take
that
off
to
stay
with
my
baby
past
my
sick
days
yup
it
was
to
also
help
pay
for
my
sub
i
only
did
that
for
3
days
then
came
back
but
also
had
to
pay
that
to
take
her
to
her
doctor
s
appointments
that
school
year
my
union
uft
is
against
the
universal
healthcare
thing
that
s
been
floating
around
ny
state
gov
proposals
since
i
became
a
mother
i
am
livid
at
them
for
not
advocating
for
this
if
they
think
that
s
what
their
members
want
i
can
t
speak
for
every
union
and
everyone
s
situation
is
different
for
many
jobs
there
is
a
five
day
work
week
for
a
reason
if
the
state
wanted
to
be
totally
fair
the
law
would
be
all
or
nothing
apply
to
all
or
apply
to
nobody
not
play
favorites
by
giving
state
and
union
employers
more
power
than
nonunion
corporate
employers
ahh
ny
has
had
pfl
for
awhile
too
this
law
is
specifically
for
pre
natal
care
so
you
don
t
have
to
start
that
52
week
clock
early
when
my
wife
was
pregnant
before
pfl
she
had
appointments
every
few
weeks
and
then
weekly
near
the
end
each
time
she
had
to
take
the
time
off
and
burned
through
her
pto
now
my
cousin
is
having
her
first
and
she
doesn
t
get
pto
from
her
job
she
has
everything
for
ready
for
pfl
but
doesn
t
want
to
start
the
clock
until
she
s
ready
to
stop
working
duh
new
york
is
one
of
the
best
states
i
dont
think
it
s
the
best
but
it
s
one
of
the
best
we
rank
in
the
10
ten
with
our
north
east
sisters
in
education
while
california
is
like
20
35
we
re
usually
one
of
the
first
states
to
vote
for
human
rights
or
in
this
case
the
first
we
re
one
of
the
few
states
who
voted
to
not
ban
tiktok
regardless
if
you
like
that
app
or
not
banning
it
is
against
our
freedom
we
re
just
better
than
your
state
and
that
s
ok
the
only
good
thing
about
california
is
the
bay
area
that
s
called
pto
time
nope
it
s
just
not
what
it
seems
like
from
the
vague
headline
very
misleading
ny
should
try
mandating
6
months
of
100
pay
for
mom
and
dad
going
on
parental
leave
no
cap
in
the
benefit
all
paid
by
the
employer
also
in
the
no
kids
by
choice
camp
here
i
m
not
disagreeing
with
you
by
any
means
i
m
just
happy
that
ny
workers
do
objectively
have
a
better
lot
than
most
folks
in
other
unions
other
states
or
other
sectors
is
it
perfect
no
definitely
not
which
union
and
do
to
you
know
who
your
council
leader
is
edit
feel
free
to
reach
out
if
you
dont
wanna
share
deets
here
since
the
house
got
capped
100
years
ago
we
ve
been
robbed
proper
representation
in
federal
government
we
would
have
to
lose
millions
for
it
to
impact
our
electoral
power
not
the
100k
or
so
we
lost
in
the
last
year
we
re
losing
people
but
not
at
nearly
enough
of
a
rate
to
lose
congressional
seats
or
electoral
votes
if
you
dont
care
about
costs
we
could
take
all
the
money
currently
being
paid
to
private
health
insurers
and
use
it
to
maintain
access
and
hospitals
and
have
the
best
coverage
on
the
planet
for
everyone
rather
than
those
who
can
afford
it
when
i
was
still
able
to
work
my
insurance
only
covered
the
cheapest
nurology
clinic
in
the
region
who
didn
t
even
have
an
epilepsy
specialist
on
staff
their
failures
in
treatment
meant
my
epilepsy
progressed
to
where
i
couldn
t
work
and
i
went
on
medicaid
medicaid
covered
100
of
the
costs
of
getting
me
treated
by
an
actual
epileptologist
at
one
of
the
best
neurology
clinics
in
the
country
we
don
t
have
to
give
up
anything
we
already
have
but
restructuring
cost
of
care
to
a
model
that
isn
t
dominated
by
3rd
party
profit
seeking
will
result
in
better
access
to
the
things
we
have
currently
the
better
doctors
and
hospitals
that
your
claiming
are
something
large
segments
of
the
population
have
0
access
to
we
would
probably
see
an
increase
in
wait
times
simply
because
more
people
would
be
in
the
position
to
get
treatment
and
there
s
only
so
much
time
in
a
day
lol
which
ones
decreases
sex
trafficking
the
study
says
neither
if
any
of
what
you
said
was
true
we
wouldn
t
have
had
women
die
in
southern
states
after
being
denied
treatment
for
miscarriage
as
it
was
classified
under
abortion
exactly
you
all
so
you
re
back
to
being
a
lemming
i
completely
agree
with
these
thank
you
for
sharing
but
if
you
have
more
good
ideas
i
d
gladly
hear
it
if
you
have
the
time
and
interest
by
your
logic
we
should
abolish
pensions
and
retirement
as
well
as
let
all
the
sick
people
die
ehh
administratively
i
don
t
think
that
would
work
this
was
the
cast
two
years
ago
when
we
had
a
kid
i
m
a
guy
and
got
12
weeks
paid
leave
the
pay
is
capped
at
about
1100
per
week
which
is
subject
to
tax
thats
hysterical
unless
it
changed
fmla
is
not
paid
but
still
unpaid
on
red
states
that
all
you
get
payments
usually
are
provided
by
blue
states
for
qualified
medical
conditions
that
was
san
francisco
s
attitude
for
a
while
the
thing
is
talent
moves
to
over
time
and
the
best
talent
already
gets
great
benefits
why
did
they
make
you
pay
more
than
your
regular
health
insurance
was
your
partner
able
to
go
to
appts
instead
if
it
was
costing
you
money
well
it
doesn
t
seem
like
that
is
the
intention
just
the
reality
of
what
they
have
had
to
use
as
leverage
in
the
cycle
to
get
more
money
or
other
benefits
bay
area
used
to
be
great
now
it
sucks
shit
and
is
full
of
assholes
nope
it
s
on
top
of
the
employee
s
pto
this
is
a
separate
bank
of
leave
time
specifically
for
prenatal
appointments
confidently
incorrect
this
new
law
is
for
20
hours
of
the
employee
s
normal
rate
of
pay
so
the
employee
will
not
be
paid
a
percentage
of
their
wages
for
this
specific
prenatal
paid
leave
they
will
be
paid
their
full
pay
rate
for
the
paid
family
leave
used
post
birth
you
are
absolutely
correct
that
the
rate
of
pay
is
a
percentage
of
the
employee
s
wages
capped
at
a
certain
amount
i
also
agree
with
you
that
a
6
month
100
paid
family
leave
program
for
both
mom
and
dad
would
be
wonderful
and
is
very
much
needed
to
support
families
hopefully
nys
will
get
there
one
day
soon
until
then
i
believe
we
can
celebrate
the
small
victories
i
would
like
that
too
but
north
of
albany
is
too
red
for
that
elise
stephanik
would
call
for
martial
law
in
ny
if
that
was
proposed
also
why
do
you
and
the
other
person
saying
headline
this

not

it

studies

how

i
don

sure
i
m

at

but
i
will
stay

ps
i
no
longer
live
in
ny
and
haven
t
in
ages
lol
that
s
not
the
logic
in
my
comment
maybe
that
s
how
your
s
works
but
all
i
said
was
that
someone
at
the
place
of
business
will
pick
up
the
slack
for
someone
else
when
they
aren
t
present
for
work
why
not
just
offer
global
universal
basic
income
you
think
someone
on
the
other
side
of
the
globe
is
less
deserving
than
you
well
it
s
better
than
what
i
had
which
was
0
it
s
obv
an
improvement
over
that
but
still
a
long
way
to
go
before
it
covers
more
of
the
middle
class
not
before
the
baby
was
born
you
didn
t
paid
family
leave
was
successfully
phased
in
over
four
years
and
time
off
and
wage
benefits
are
now
at

target
levels
if
you
are
eligible
and
have
a

event
you
can

up

12

off
the

is

details
on
what
s
new
for

is
that
why
tesla
moved
their
engineering
team
back
to
ca
lol
it
was
health
insurance
pay
for
a
substitute
me
personally
i
had
mostly
great
experiences
with
bay
area
people
except
oakland
men
a
guy
from
richmond
i
dated
people
from
la
though
both
natives
and
transits
they
re
the
worst
people
ever
i
really
do
not
get
some
people
yes
it
could
be
better
but
something
is
better
than
nothing
elise
stephanik
has
nothing
to
do
with
ny
state
law
how
the
hell
did
we
lose
a
seat
while
losing
less
than
the
population
of
some
of
the
smallest
districts
i
m
not
saying
your
source
isn
t
correct
but
this
just
makes
me
even
angrier
about
the
cap
on
hor
seats
their
failures
in
treatment
meant
my
epilepsy
progressed
to
where
i
couldn
t
work
and
i
went
on
medicaid
did
you
just
skip
that
part
and
jump
to
saying
i
was
wrong
i
m
disabled
due
in
part
to
the
fact
that
my
private
insurance
wouldn
t
cover
the
quality
of
treatment
i
needed
what
does
the
cost
of
m4a
matter
i
thought
you
didn
t
care
about
what
it
costs
or
did
you
just
mean
your
lucky
enough
to
be
able
to
work
and
afford
it
so
who
cares
about
the
rest
of
the
country
weird
defense
but
ok
thanks
i
appreciate
you
sharing
your
knowledge
i
want
to
become
a
politician
myself
someday
and
i
agree
that
a
good
chunk
of
the
establishment
is
out
of
touch
and
is
dismissive
of
many
concerns
of
americans
no
they
re
just
not
here
in
the
us
and
they
re
not
contributing
to
our
economy
you
didn
t
save
up
prior
i
mean
they
have
to
give
them
benefits
beyond
the
state
minimums
so
yeah
probably
a
fine
move
and
no
doubt
tcalifornia
s
engineering
talent
is
second
to
none
california
will
always
benefit
from
having
perhaps
the
best
weather
and
nature
on
the
globe
in
my
opinion
california
will
always
be
able
to
recover
should
they
choose
that
said
even
the
land
of
milk
and
honey
can
swing
the
pendulum
too
far
that
s
literally
insane
they
probably
had
been
there
a
long
time
like
their
family
goes
back
decades
those
people
are
cool
if
you
go
there
now
those
people
are
mostly
gone
and
displaced
by
the
worst
people
in
america
la
is
a
pit
but
rest
of
socal
is
great
santa
barbara
big
sur
sonora
eureka
lake
tahoe
lots
of
great
places
in
the
state
but
ny
number
1
absolutely
every
little
bit
helps
nys
is
not
perfect
and
neither
is
this
law
but
we
have
it
much
better
than
a
lot
of
other
states
do
this
is
another
step
in
the
right
direction
my
point
is
that
it
s
misleading
claiming
this
win
for
doing
a
fraction
of
what
other
countries
do
fyi
massachusetts
has
almost
the
exact
same
program
i
m
getting
1150
per
week
right
now
on
mass
parental
leave
are
you
that
dense
i
was
making
a
figurative
statement
about
how
she
would
call
for
martial
law
she
has
no
power
to
declare
martial
law
in
any
scenario
anyone
can
say
there
should
be
martial
law
does
not
mean
it
will
happen
we
lost
it
by
like
80
people
on
the
census
too
probably
not
exactly
80
but
some
ludicrously
small
number
edit
it
was
89

i
m
disabled
due
in
part
to
the
fact
that
my
private
insurance
wouldn
t
cover
the
quality
of
treatment
i
needed
happens
in
all
countries
how
is
partly
their
fault
though
running
for

is
not
for
me
a
political
consultant
possibly
i
do
have
a
ba
ma
and
phd
in
history
it
would
have
to
be
the
perfect
campaign
not
entirely
true
most
of
the
world
s
adoption
of
the
us
dollar
standard
subsidizes
your
standard
of
living
not
for
long
though
i
did
that
s
not
the
point
though
they
recently
negotiated
it
out
of
the
contract
but
yeah
it
totally
sucked
parental
prenatal
so
go
comment
in
the
mass
sub
about
how
ny
sucks
for
trying
no
goddammit
the
average
congressional
district
is
larger
than
the
population
of
wyoming
and
we
lost
a
seat
over
89
people
i
sware
our
government
will
do
anything
it
can
to
avoid
equity
of
voting
power
because
they
only
covered
1
neurology
clinic
in
the
region
and
it
was
one
that
didn
t
provide
proper
care
one
of
the
first
things
that
came
up
once
i
started
going
to
the
nsri
at
albany
med
was
that
i
shouldn
t
have
been
on
some
of
the
meds
i
was
taking
at
the
same
time
yeah
trump
is
going
to
destroy
the
worth
of
the
dollar
the
point
is
the
government
should
support
people
d
a
m
mothers
against
dyslexia
no
i
m
not
sure
what
all
you
tried
after
they
denied
you
but
that
s
not
typically
the
end
all
be
all
my
wife
s
patients
get
denied
all
the
time
and
still
end
up
getting
approved
i
don
t
believe
he
has
much
if
any
control
of
the
us
dollar
correct
it
s
not
the
same
as
prior
authorization
they
simply
didn
t
do
bussiness
with
anyone
else
in
the
area
and
i
was
being
treated
by
the
clinic
they
did
cover
the
doctor
i
was
seeing
would
ve
had
to
essentially
say
that
they
weren
t
qualified
to
address
my
illness
i
wasn
t
activly
denied
anything
i
was
just
stuck
with
a
neurology
clinic
that
didn
t
have
the
capacity
to
provide
the
level
of
care
i
needed
i
could
have
pursued
other
clinics
but
it
would
have
been
entirely
out
of
pocket
why
should
you
have
to
work
at
all
so
then
what
would
you
have
liked
to
see
done
if
there
wasn
t
anyone
else
that
could
help
you
you
re
right
nobody
should
feel
like
they
need
to
stay
trapped
in
a
job
that
they
hate
just
to
make
ends
meet
good
point
once
my
seizures
were
occurring
so
regularly
that
i
was
unable
to
work
medicaid
covered
me
for
treatment
at
the
neuro
science
research
institute
at
albany
med
they
were
able
to
provide
the
care
i
needed
they
re
one
of
the
best
epilepsy
clinics
in
the
world
the
private
insurance
i
was
on
refused
to
cover
being
treated
there
so
i
was
getting
treatment
from
a
clinic
that
didn
t
have
nearly
the
quality
of
care
that
i
received
and
continue
to
recieved
via
medicaid
and
now
medicare
it
was
cheaper
to
send
me
to
a
clinic
that
didn
t
even
have
an
epilepsy
specialist
on
staff
and
it
resulted
in
my
seizures
continuing
to
get
worse
had
they
been
willing
to
cover
the
expense
of
sending
me
to
someone
competent
i
likely
wouldn
t
be
in
the
situation
that
i
am
now
there
were
other
people
who
could
help
my
insurance
refused
to
cover
them
so
it
sounds
like
the
system
worked
and
you
got
the
coverage
you
needed
what
am
i
missing
if
i
had
been
getting
proper
treatment
from
the
beginning
my
epilepsy
would
likely
have
never
progressed
to
the
point
where
i
don
t
have
the
capacity
to
work
every
seizure
an
epileptic
has
causes
brain
damage
which
reduces
the
threshold
for
the
next
1
i
had
at
least
20
seizures
that
if
i
had
been
getting
proper
treatment
i
would
probably
never
have
had
i
have
permanent
brain
damage
because
the
insurance
i
was
paying
for
only
covered
the
cheapest
option
in
the
region
instead
of
covering
the
level
medical
care
that
my
case
warranted
there
s
kind
of
a
similar
thing
here
in
buffalo
habitat
for
humanity
is
planning
on
constructing
a
facility
to
allow
them
to
build
like
80ish
prefab
homes
a
year
i
mean
the
housing
cost
problem
isn
t
actually
a
construction
cost
problem
it
s
a
supply
issue
just
allow
more
multi
family
buildings
i
m
so
confused
by
this
we
already
know
what
these
homes
are
what
test
are
they
doing
champion
has
been
making
trailers
manufactured
homes
and
cheap
modulars
for
years
yeeeears
people
put
up
these
homes
all
the
time
everywhere
i
m
glad
they
re
doing
it
someone
has
to
put
a
dent
in
the
housing
issues
in
this
country
but
there
s
no
need
to
test
something
that
everyone
s
been
doing
since
like
the
70s
it
works
we
already
know
it
works
lol
low
to
moderate
income
of
130
000
to
150
000
the
median
household
income
for
syracuse
metro
is
like
74
000
why
do
we
need
to
test
this
prefab
homes
have
been
a
thing
for
decades
the
amount
of
regulations
on
new
construction
makes
sure
that
new
homes
arent
affordable
we
do
not
need
more
homes
we
need
corporations
and
foreign
business
entities
to
stop
buying
up
houses
and
arbitrarily
inflating
prices
so
they
can
profit
off
the
fact
that
housing
is
a
basic
human
necessity
in
high
demand
we
need
property
taxes
to
come
down
we
need
rent
to
come
down
we
need
the
housing
market
to
chill
the
fuck
out
there
are
something
like
almost
30
uninhabited
houses
for
every
homeless
person
in
the
country
we
don
t
need
more
we
need
solutions
to
the
actual
problems
here
and
the
problem
isn
t
not
enough
houses
destroy
regulations
stopping
land
development
asap
we
have
to
test
to
see
if
you
can
build
housing
and
sell
it
for
an
affordable
price
will
the
real
estate
market
survive
be
careful
here
a
home
is
the
highest
expense
most
people
will
ever
have
there
are
already
a
lot
of
shoddy
builders
out
there
let
s
not
make
it
even
easier
to
rip
people
off
that
s
the
orange
man
s
way
don
t
do
it
here
we
do
need
more
homes
built
home
construction
rate
collapsed
after
the
great
recession
and
never
recovered
housing
unit
supply
is
absolutely
an
issue
and
probably
the
biggest
issue
we
ve
been
running
a
unit
building
deficit
since
the
2008
financial
crisis
and
has
hit
another
lull
post
covid
https

houst
it
s
not
hard
to
understand
that
less
units
means
landlords
can
charge
more
in
rent
when
you
can
barely
afford
higher
rent
you
re
broke
when
you
can
t
afford
rent
you
re
homeless
private
equity
is
absolutely
an
issue
better
addressed
now
before
it
s
too
late
but
it
s
not
causing
the
current
housing
situation
only
about
5
of
units
are
owned
by
private
equity
and
even
less
by
foreign
owners
this
number
will
increase
as
long
as
real
estate
continues
to
be
a
great
investment
because
of
the
inflated
cost
of
housing
from
relative
scarcity
which
brings
us
back
to
increasing
the
supply
my
cousin
spent
2
years
and
10
15k
just
on
permits
you
could
build
a
million
new
homes
but
if
corporations
buy
them
all
up
or
people
can
t
afford
the
property
taxes
and
col
nothing
will
change
i
do
not
understand
how
you
can
say
that
when
there
are
there
are
something
like
almost
30
uninhabited
houses
for
every
homeless
person
in
the
country
you
can
populate
every
square
inch
of
the
planet
with
houses
but
if
people
can
t
afford
those
houses
because
the
property
taxes
are
too
high
or
companies
are
buying
up
all
the
houses
or
gentrification
is
pricing
people
out
or
people
aren
t
being
paid
a
living
wage
it
s
not
going
to
help
that
s
nuts
and
that
s
all
local
we
also
produce
more
than
enough
food
to
feed
everyone
yet
people
still
go
hungry
logistics
and
inefficiencies
exist
especially
when
it
comes
to
stationary
and
expensive
things
like
homes
that
require
long
process
to
transfer
ownership
a
home
in
disrepair
in
manhattan
ks
doesn
t
help
someone
on
the
street
in
manhattan
ny
how
many
of
those
vacant
homes
are
in
areas
where
there
are
jobs
how
many
of
those
homes
are
livable
and
not
in
disrepair
how
many
are

for

gentrification
is
a
local

it

the
thing
that
has
changed
relative
to
previous
decades
is
that
we
ve
been
building
significantly
less
homes
for
almost
two
decades
and
it
s
hitting
us
hard
we
ve
been
building
less
in
the
past
16
years
than
any
decade
since
the
1960s
when
we
have
decent
data

in
previous
post
the
us
population
was
180
million
in
1960
in
2020
it
was
330
million
we
can
t
build
fewer
homes
than
we
did
in
the
60s
and
expect
people
to
be
able
to
afford
housing
the
way
to
reduce
the
price
of
homes
is
to
build
more
homes
we
tried
this
it
isn

the

solution
to
the
problem
that
you
think
it
is
you
can
deforest
and

the

but
if
you
don
t
pay
people
enough
to
afford
the

and

themselves
you
will
not
have

the

they

the

can
have
a
big

here
i
can
t
answer
the
specifics
of
your
question
but
the
overarching
answer
is
that
we
never
fully
transitioned
out
of
feudalism
so
something
akin
to
serfdom
remains
it
is
a
position
not
to
be
controverted
that
the
earth
in
its
natural
uncultivated
state
was
and
ever
would
have
continued
to
be
common
property
of
the
human
race
in
that
state
every
man
would
have
been
born
to
property
cultivation
is
at
least
one
of
the
greatest
natural
improvements
ever
made
by
human
invention
but
the
landed
monopoly
that
began
with
it
has
produced
the
greatest
evil
it
has
dispossessed
more
than
half
the
inhabitants
of
every
nation
of
their
natural
inheritance
and
has
thereby
created
a
species
of
poverty
and
wretchedness
that
did
not
exist

another
means
of
silently
lessening

inequality
of

that
fact
that
it
s
a
flat
income
cutoffs
shows
how
out
of
touch
our
leadership
is
my
household
income
is
in
the
95th
percentile
for
monroe
county
95th
percentile
is
187k
well
under
the
300k
limit
we
don
t
need
the
money
i
d
rather
people
making
less
get
it
we
don
t
need
a
check
we
need
you
to
make
housing
more
affordable
that
check
is
going
to
go
directly
into
the
landlords
pocket
so
i
wonder
how
many
people
on
here
whining
that
we
just
need
to
build
more
affordable
housing
voted
for
trump
because
that
was
100
part
of
harris
plan
what
could
go
wrong
so
i
pay
taxes
so
get
a
check
to
pay
for
groceries
which
i
can
t
afford
in
part
because
of
how
high
taxes
are
god
she
s
such
a
dumbass
how
much
did
the
state
spend
on
housing
illegal
immigrants
ubi
would
be
great
for
residents
even
500
a
month
would
help
so
many
i
ll
take
a
one
time
check
of
course
but
one
of
the
most
prosperous
states
should
do
more
for
the
security
of
its
residents
considering
the
1200
checks
we
got
apparently
destroyed
the
economy
with
inflation
by
making
every
seller
increase
the
prices
of
everything
this
is
only
going
to
make
everything
worse
again
not
even
progressives
know
how
to
make
their
cities
affordable
only
thing
missing
from
the
article
is
how
hochul
plans
to
pin
blame
on
the
past
3
years
of
high
inflation
on
trump
it
has
to
be
his
fault
definitely
not
hers
or
bidens
give
you
your
money
back
collected
via
taxes
when
your
ratings
are
in
the
toilet
and
you
just
passed
an
incredibly
unpopular
confiscatory
tax
you
need
a
hail
mary
pass
for
a
family
of
4
in
upstate
new
york
i
spend
300
a
week
on
groceries
food
household
supplies
etc
how
is
a
1
time
payment
of
500
going
to
make
a
dent
in
anything
i
use
to
spend
300
every
2
weeks
lower
the
cost
of
groceries
stop
raising
minimum
wage
to
the
point
that
trade
workers
are
making
the
same
as
unskilled
workers
make
it
so
companies
can
not
raise
the
price
and
lower
the
amount
of
goods
in
the
package
she
is
just
saying
this
crap
to
get
reelected
this
is
not
going
to
help
anybody
long
term
not
sure
this
behavior
can
fully
be
blocked
but
at
the
very
least
there
needs
to
be
an
insane
tax
penalty
on
investment
properties
seeing
as
there
are
tons
of
people
out
there
who
could
actually
use
them
as
places
to
live
tax
the
fuck
out
of
them
and
then
use
the
money
for
housing
programs
ideally
the
penalty
will
be
so
high
that
it
will
effectively
stop
the
behavior
as
investors
to
invest
in
something
else
they
own
500
00
homes
in
the
us
meanwhile
we
ve
let
in
10m
immigrants
who
need
housing
the
bigger
number
should
be
more
concerning
it
s
all
those
conniving
new
york
republicans
in
the
way
those
superminority
state
legislators
some
guys
at
that
one
bocce
club
in
staten
island
a
couple
of
deer
hunters
in
elmira
and
those
goofballs
in
pickup
trucks
in
putnam
county
and
al
d
amato
they
are
blocking
utopia
and
must
be
purged
and
start
disincentivizing
landlording
landhoarding
seriously
this
is
the
easiest
solution
but
it
won
t
get
done
because
then
they
can
t
take
credit
for
it
i
was
telling
my
wife
the
other
day
i
m
an
independent
who
s
voted
for
the
dems
in
pretty
much
every
contest
and
every
election
in
the
state
since
moving
here
over
a
decade
ago
but
given
the
rampant
corruption
in
albany
right
now
and
general
incompetence
of
hochul
and
her
team
all
it
s
going
to
take
is
a
moderate
republican
who
s
not
insane
or
anti
abortion
to
get
me
to
give
them
a
real
serious
look
and
my
vote
if
the
republicans
out
there
are
listening
this
means
no
maga
no
pro
lifer
a
competent
and
reasonable
moderate
etc
basically
give
us
a
nys
version
of
phil
scott
as
an
option
and
i
m
all
ears
eff
that
lower
property
and
income
taxes
on
everyone
making
less
than
100k
ftfy
us
working
people
it
could
with
relative
ease
come
from
cuts
in
other
areas
of
the
budget
and
new
funds
from
cannabis
taxes
it
s
going
to
come
from
the
state
budget
meaning
tax
dollars
but
it
s
probably
doable
without
increasing
taxes
if
thats
what
you
re
asking
literally
the
whole
point
of
the
thing
is
that
there
is
more
sales
tax
revenue
due
to
inflated
retail
prices
what
part
of
that
don
t
you
understand
why
are
you
adding
quotes
to
fix
when
nobody
said
that
except
for
you
the
theory
behind
it
is
that
the
state
collected
more
in
sales
taxes
than
usual
due
to
inflation
so
this
is
essentially
a
refund
for
the
extra
taxes
people
paid
thanks
to
rising
costs
i
m
sure
somebody
could
probably
come
up
a
different
use
of
the
money
but
absolutely
nobody
is
proposing
it
as
a
fix
it
may
or
may
not
be
dumb
but
let
s
recall
that
just
last
year
hochul
did
send
out
stimulus
check
i
think
they
were
extra
star
checks
to
homeowners
but
maybe
my
memory
is
wrong
about
that
so
it
absolutely
can
happen
vacancy
taxes
affordable
housing
development
legislation
to
prevent
mass
ownership
it
could
be
blocked
easily
it

don

and
shell
companies
run
by
russian

chinese

the

wouldn

the
infringe

homeowners
right
to

to
whom
they
choose
love
it
i
know
thank
you
spot
on
who
cares
so
you
have
a
relevant
clause
of
the
new
york
state
constitution
that
would
be
conflicting
with
such
a
law
there
has
been
no
right
to
contract
in
the
us
since
the
end
of
the
lockner
era
with
the
new
deal
and
certainly
since
the
civil
rights
movement
i
would
be
shocked
if
a
court
argued
the
state
government
couldn
t
regulate
the
sale
and
ownership
of
real
property
barring
conflicting
federal
law
and
thus
the
supremacy
clause
it
would
be
a
radical
break
with
20th
century
jurisprudence
the
homeowners
just
because
there
isn
t
a
specific
part
of
the
constitution
that
protects
something
doesn
t
mean
it
s
legal
to
ban
that
thing
and
even
if
the
state
had
the
legal
power
to
ban
something
doesn
t
mean
it
s
a
good
idea
or
right
too
bad
don
t
sell
the
country
to
foreign
powers
waaaah
waaah
i
want
more
money
i
don
t
care
about
anything
but
money
just
because
there
isn
t
a
specific
part
of
the
constitution
that
protects
something
doesn
t
mean
it
s
legal
to
ban
that
thing
no
that
s
really
how
the
constitution
works
sure
the
justices
can
do
some
legal
gymnastics
to
get
to
a
desired
result
which
they
often
do
but
that
isn
t
the
intent
and
even
if
the
state
had
the
legal
power
to
ban
something
doesn
t
mean
it
s
a
good
idea
or
right
that
s
a
separate
conversation
that
i
m
not
interested
in
participating
in
what
difference
does
it
make
if
they
re
foreign
or
not
isn
t
this
entire
issue
about
money
the
ninth
amendment
states
the
enumeration
in
the
constitution
of
certain
rights
shall
not
be
construed
to
deny
or
disparage
others
retained
by
the
people
what
does
that
mean
to
you
why
aren
t
you
interested
in
talking
about
the
actual
merits
of
such
a
proposal
lol
american
dream
the
ninth
amendment
was
written
to
restrict
the
federal
government
to
the
powers
enumerated
in
the
original
text
of
the
constitution
the
federal
government
was
never
meant
to
have
power
beyond
that
the
bill
of
rights
was
not
applied
to
the
several
states
until
the
late
19th
and
early
20th
century
with
the
doctrine
of
incorporation
birthed
from
the
14th
amendment
the
ninth
has
not
been
incorporated
to
apply
to
the
states
except
loosely
in
griswold
and
roe
the
interpretation
of
the
ninth
would
be
completely
at
odds
with
wickard
v
filburn
which
has
only
ever
once
been
limited
by
the
supreme
court
and
that
was
a
case
about
federal
gun
free
school
zones
that
is
such
an
interpretation
is
not
in
line
with
the
historical
intent
of
the
ninth
amendment
nor
its
current
jurisprudence
much
like
the
10th
amendment
its
a
largely
dead
amendment
as
an
example
the
common
law
right
to
contract
hasn
t
existed
since
the
end
of
the
lochner
era
why
aren
t
you
interested
in
talking
about
the
actual
merits
of
such
a
proposal
because
i
m
not
i
only
commented
with
regards
to
the
legal
question
because
that
question
is
more
interesting
that
didn
t
answer
the
question
what
difference
is
it
if
my
landlord
is
american
french
or
chinese
how
would
the
constitution
apply
if
not
in
the
states
were
states
allowed
to
infringe
on
the
first
amendment
in
the
early
19th
century
what
do
you
think
the
historical
intent
of
the
9th
amendment
was
don
t
say
foolish
things
like
you
don
t
understand
how
economics
and
supply
and
demand
work
if
the
real
estate
markets
aren
t
being
pumped
up
the
way
they
are
people
could
afford
their
own
homes
since
the
doctrine
of
incorporation
that
is
true
prior
to
that
the
first
amendment
only
applied
to
congress
several
states
maintained
state
churches
after
the
firat
amendment
was
ratified
if
you
ban
foreign
ownership
american
corporations
would
just
buy
the
houses
and
then
foreigners
would
buy
shares
in
the
american
corporations
the
demand
would
stay
the
same
again
what
does
the
nationality
matter
that
s
pretty
interesting
so
why
does
that
doctrine
restrict
states
from
infringing
the
first
amendment
and
not
the
ninth
you
really
aren
t
paying
attention
foreign
oligarchs
are
laundering
money
in
this
country
by
buying
up
real
estate
through
shell
companies
your
counterpoint
is
utterly
moot
because
the
ninth
has
not
been
incorporated
the
court
hasn
t
done
that
except
for
abortion
and
birth
control
access
and
the
court
recently
went
back
on
abortion
access
incorporating
the
ninth
would
be
legally
impossible
how
would
a
right
be
determined
it
would
be
ad
hoc
and
chaotic
which
is
why
it
largely
hasn
t
been
done
what
proportion
of
houses
owned
by
corporations
are
owned
by
foreign
oligarchs
through
shell
companies
why
would
the
9th
restricting
states
be
any
more
chaotic
than
restricting
the
federal
government
read
the
brooking
article
it
s
unknown
because
of
shell
companies
yes
the
ninth
stops
the
federal
government
from
exceeding
its
enumerated
authority
unlike
the
federal
government
states
have
full
sovereignty
except
where
prohibited
by
the
constitution
their
governing
authority
is
not
enumerated
rather
their
limitations
are
enumerated
incorporating
the
ninth
is
almost
meaningless
because
the
states
aren
t
limited
in
their
power
by
enumeration
of
powers
if
the
ninth
were
incorporated
any
person
could
claim
a
right
to
anything
you
d
have
this
horrible
ad
hoc
application
that
would
be
impossible
to
properly
adjudicate
then
how
do
you
know
it
s
a
problem
but
how
would
that
be
different
from
people
claiming
unenumerated
rights
with
respect
to
the
federal
government
right
now
the
federal
government
isn
t
paralyzed
by
chaotic
claims
of
ninth
amendment
violations
how
do
you
think
and
breathe
at
the
same
time
how
long
do
you
think
you
can
get
me
to
keep
replying
to
you
no
wait
do
you
think
you
re
super
smart
and
you
laugh
every
time
i
reply
that
person
can
point
to
congress
not
having
the
enumerated
authority
to
act
against
that
right
the
modern
commerce
clause
elastic
clause
has
given
congress
almost
unlimited
authority
wickard
v
filburn
is
the
foundational
case
for
the
modern
federal
government
congress
wrote
a
law
limiting
the
amount
of
wheat
any
one
person
could
grow
wickard
grew
wheat
in
excess
of
that
amount
but
argued
the
excess
amount
was
for
domestic
consumption
and
thus
not
commerce
the
court
agreed
but
stated
that
any
non
commercial
activity
that
if
enough
people
participated
in
could
have
an
aggregate
affect
on
interstate
commerce
can
be
regulated
as
intestate
commerce
this
eliminates
basically
any
economic
rights
there
are
only
two
exceptions
to
date
griswold
v
connecticut
and
its
antecedents
including
roe
v
wade
which
is
now
overturned
and
us
v
lopez
the
former
was
the
right
to
privacy
while
the
latter
was
ruled
that
congress
did
not
show
cause
that
the
impacts
of
gun
free
school
zones
had
an
affect
on
intestate
commerce
i
find
it
funny
and
sad
how
incapable
you
are
of
engaging
with
people
who
disagree
with
you
literally
all
i
asked
is
why
do
you
think
that
and
instead
of
explaining
why
you
just
insult
me
i
m
for
real
how
do
you
know
foreign
oligarchs
buying
housing
is
a
big
problem
compared
to
regular
american
hedge
funds
and
how
do
you
know
banning
foreign
ownership
of
housing
would
do
anything
to
stop
that
problem
if
the
shell
companies
could
simply
buy
shares
of
vnq
vanguard
s
real
estate
etf
if
we
re
basing
what
s
legal
and
what
s
not
legal
on
the
actions
of
the
supreme
court
and
they
have
demonstrated
to
be
just
9
humans
with
human
whims
what
legal
basis
do
we
have
to
say
anything
like
the
ninth
amendment
exists
it
says
what
it
says
and
if
the
supreme
court
can
just
ignore
it
why
have
a
constitution
at
all
the
ninth
exists
within
its
historical
context
how
does
one
define
a
right
out
of
the
9th
amendment
does
it
have
to
be
a
right
from
english
common
law
preceding
the
9th
amendment
s
enactment
can
it
be
something
conjured
out
of
this
air
does
every
sovereign
citizen
have
a
right
to
travel
without
a
driver
s
license
per
the
9th
that
s
why
it
s
a
dead
amendment
it
just
says
that
just
because
a
right
isn
t
enumerated
by
the
previous
amendment
doesn
t
mean
it
doesn
t
exist
those
questions
existed
even
when
it
was
written
was
it
dead
on
arrival
one
doesn
t
define
a
right
from
it
alone
it
just
tells
us
there
s
more
that
can
be
defined
like
the
right
to
sell
my
house
to
whom
i
wish
one
still
needs
to
make
an
argument
about
why
that
is
should
be
a
right
it
just
says
that
just
because
a
right
isn
t
enumerated
by
the
previous
amendment
doesn
t
mean
it
doesn
t
exist
those
questions
existed
even
when
it
was
written
was
it
dead
on
arrival
mostly
yes
there
isn
t
case
law
on
the
ninth
what
we
have
is
the
federalist
and
anti
fefederalist
papers
and
notes
from
the
framers
about
what
their
concerns
were
and
what
the
meaning
was
from
the
federalist
perspective
the
entire
bill
of
rights
was
redundant
because
congress
had
no
such
powers
to
violate
these
rights
to
begin
with
that
s
why
federalist
were
so
willing
to
concede
the
bill
of
rights
to
the
anti
federalists
they
didn
t
think
they
were
conceding
anything
one
doesn
t
define
a
right
from
it
alone
it
just
tells
us
there
s
more
that
can
be
defined
like
the
right
to
sell
my
house
to
whom
i
wish
one
still
needs
to
make
an
argument
about
why
that
is
should
be
a
right
then
one
would
have
to
find
a
right
from
english
common
law
preceding
the
enactment
of
the
amendment
the
right
would
need
to
exist
in
law
and
the
only
law
preceding
the
constitution
was
english
common
law
why
does
one
need
to
find
a
law
that
already
had
existed
to
prove
a
right
eventually
you
hit
a
wall
not
every
law
is
based
on
previous
law
that
right
would
have
needed
to
exist
at
the
time
of
the
enactment
to
be
supported
by
the
amendment
that
s
how
law
works
the
english
common
law
is
not
statutory
like
modern
law
it
is
a
series
of
court
rulings
going
back
to
the
origins
of
the
kingdom
of
england
the
singular
best
source
that
almost
every
jurist
uses
is
blackstone
s
commentaries
on
the
common
law
if
you
wanted
to
create
a
new
right
it
would
need
to
be
enumerated
into
the
constitution
but
why
must
one
refer
to
previous
laws
at
all
especially
ones
from
a
different
country
like
why
does
the
ruling
of
some
medieval
english
court
matter
to
us
in
modern
america
english
common
law
became
american
common
law
all
of
the
american
colonies
were
under
the
english
common
law
system
when
the
colonies
declared
independence
they
didn
t
turn
into
lawless
territories
they
kept
the
english
common
law
the
english
common
law
wasn
t
abolished
in
most
us
states
until
the
mid
to
late
20th
century
as
for
the
right
existing
in
the
common
law
that
is
the
origins
of
the
rights
in
the
bill
of
rights
they
have
theriot
roots
in
english
common
law
and
specifically
blackstone
s
commentaries
if
there
is
a
right
the
framers
of
the
9th
amendment
were
referring
to
it
would
have
existed
in
common
law
how
can
the
9th
amendment
refer
to
a
right
that
didn
t
exist
at
the
time
of
enactment
who
says
the
9th
amendment
only
protects
rights
previously
established
by
english
common
law
it
protects
rights
not
enumerated
in
the
constitution
the
only
other
place
those
rights
would
exist
then
is
the
english
common
law
otherwise
there
would
be
no
basis
for
the
right
and
no
legal
standing
to
claim
it
what
legal
standing
did
those
common
law
decisions
use
to
arrive
at
their
decisions
history
of
old
laws
two
factors
that
stand
out
1
this
guy
went
straight
for
the
ceo
and
not
some
middle
management
person
2
young
intelligent
and
due
to
his
advantage
of
being
upper
class
used
these
resources
at
his
disposable
to
commit
what
he
did
most
crimes
we
hear
about
are
middle
to
lower
class
and
deals
with
the
criminals
who
are
either
strung
out
lowly
educated
and
just
didn
t
have
the
best
resources
in
life
what
s
grabbing
about
this
is
he
can
relate
to
many
in
the
working
to
middle
upper
class
that
are
frustrated
by
the
healthcare
system
and
can
t
find
a
means
to
change
any
of
it
i
m
sure
more
conversations
about
the
actual
morality
of
health
insurance
will
surface
once
the
trial
begins
perhaps
this
is
exactly
what
was
needed
unfortunately
to
bring
attention
to
this
matter
in
the
long
run
he
was
a
member
of
the
ruling
class
so
no
expense
was
spared
to
catch
his
killer
to
send
the
message
that
the
ruling
class
is
off
limits
the
ruling
class
also
owns
every
source
of
information
so
we
see
only
their
spin
on
everythign
because
of
his
status
it
s
the
elite
protecting
eachother
that
simple
police
isn
t
much
for
crime
it
s
tax
payer
funded
security
for
the
rich
what
made
me
sick
about
all
of
this
is
how
hard
the
governments
and
media
tried
to
find
this
guy
had
a
regular
person
been
killed
which
happens
every
day
there
s
usually
not
even
a
follow
up
story
about
it
it
was
just
decided
that
this
ceo
s
life
was
more
valuable
and
that
was
that
they
have
to
villainize
him
because
they
are
scared
of
a
much
needed
uprising
because
the
ceo
indirectly
ruined
many
lives
to
become
a
billionare

you

put

because
rich
people
matter
more
than
anyone
else
in
our
society
if
something
affects
them
negatively
government
will
snap
to
it
to
ensure
their
needs
come
first
over
the
needs
of
the
average
citizen
it
doesn
t
really
matter
what
most
voters
want
the
only
thing
that
counts
is
who
can
donate
the
most
to
politicians
to
get
what
they
want
it
s
called
class
warfare
not
class
discourse
because
people
find
it
very
compelling
news
that
people
find
interesting
generates
more
views
and
in
turn
more
media
coverage
the
reason
why
people
find
it
compelling
is
that
they
find
the
killer
s
motives
relatable
which
is
unusual
to
experience
towards
a
murderer
the
story
boils
down
to
a
smart
educated
and
seemingly
reasonable
yet
radical
person
dispensing
justice
against
the
health
insurance
industry
i
m
not
saying
that
s
what
he
is
but
that
s
what
people
understand
about
him
people
at
large
deep
down
find
an
instant
connection
to
this
guy
they
re
curious
about
what
he
was
wearing
what
he
did
where
he
escaped
to
and
what
he
must
have
experienced
people
are
fascinated
by
him
and
what
to
know
more
about
him
and
what
happens
to
him
i
think
it
s
a
manifestation
of
general
frustration
at
healthcare
administration
everyone
has
had
scenarios
at
hospitals
insurance
where
silly
bureaucracy
gets
in
the
way
of
actual
care
so
i
love
how
these
types
of
comments
are
always
preceded
with
murder
not
good
as
if
that
goes
on
to
defend
the
next
paragraph
rant
of
basically
saying
it
s
kind
of
sort
of
ok
it
s
amazing
that
right
after
this
guy
was
murdered
our
health
care
premiums
went
down
and
coverage
went
up
excellent
it
s
the
ceo
of
a
healthcare
not
some
random
corporations
even
though
most
are
corrupt
everyone
in
their
life
will
need
healthcare
at
some
point
and
the
way
they
fuck
over
people
isn
t
covered
the
way
it
should
be
which
is
why
the
murder
of
the
ceo
from
unh
is
a
huge
deal
now
we
know
info
about
the
killer
not
being
insane
but
the
complete
opposite
as
a
role
model
student
who
was
the
valedictorian
two
degrees
from
ivy
league
school
and
frat
boy
will
make
this
an
even
bigger
deal
on
what
caused
him
and
only
him
to
murder
the
ceo
of
a
healthcare
company
the
story
is
bigger
than
ever
now
he
s
caught
alive
wait
until
the
trial
and
the
amount
of
protesting
there
will
be
it
s
a
story
that
we
all
have
some
kind
of
relationship
to
it
has
unclear
protagonists
and
antagonists
complexity
and
circumstances
that
we
haven
t
become
complacent
about
i
m
dealing
with
a
homicide
in
my
own
family
and
the
chaos
invited
by
public
interest
because
the
justice
system
failed
so
i
ve
had
some
time
to
mull
over
what
is
different
the
controversy
is
likely
to
evoke
strong
feelings
with
no
clear
answers
killing
a
person
for
doing
their
job
is
definitely
not
legal
it
raises
questions
about
what
the
law
protects
because
people
seem
to
have
different
allegiances
given
his
impact
for
example
it
s
one
thing
to
be
the
umpire
who
makes
tough
calls
but
i
don
t
think
people
care
about
someone
who
makes
those
calls
largely
based
on
financial
considerations
while
profiting
from
them
when
an
umpire
could
make
a
different
call
everything
i
just
wrote
raises
more
interesting
questions
than
most
murders
which
tend
to
lack
this
complexity
because
they
are
often
driven
by
poor
impulse
control
mental
health
poor
coping
skills
mental
health
jealousy
greed
or
other
pointless
deaths
that
are
easy
to
dismiss
as
uninteresting
and
tragic
this
murder
involves
someone
unexpected
blatantly
killing
another
person
and
going
through
the
process
of
referencing
literature
on
the
casing
of
the
bullets
shot
into
their
target
what
s
going
to
be
interesting
is
how
people
respond
to
this
we
ve
already
seen
coincidental
changes
in
major
health
insurance
policy
such
as
blue
cross
blue
shield
reversing
a
decision
about
anesthesia
in
the
wake
of
the
shooting
what
s
more
dangerous
is
if
this
is
the
most
effective
way
to
accomplish
change
as
opposed
to
just
a
breach
point
it
likely
won
t
be
the
last
time
someone
makes
by
bullet
through
their
target
frankly
i
m
just
glad
it
s
not
a
school
cause
the
inspiration
for
others
i
think
this
is
a
big
deal
because
of
the
motive
outside
that
it
s
just
another
tragic
murder
if
he
wasn
t
a
ceo
his
death
would
already
be
old
news
cause
the
police
don
t
care
when
poor
people
get
killed
you
ll
never
see
them
do
all
that
over
a
regular
person
dying
a
billionaire
though
a
whole
manhunt
lol
they
want
to
appease
the
elites
it
s
just
very
out
of
the
ordinary
it
also
reminds
me
of
the
unabomber
who
has
a
cult
following
these
people
are

it

statement

did

who
is
most
likely
solely
responsible
for
thousands
of
people
dying
families
suffering
financial
ruin
just
to
name
a
few
it
was
a
political
assasination
because
an
execution
was
widely
celebrated
and
a
cold
blooded
murderer
is
being
hailed
as
some
kind
of
hero
it
exposes
a
mentality
reminiscent
of
the
treatment
of
the
kulaks
in

russia
where
extermination
is
justified
if
the
victim
is
perceived
as
a
member

see
also

china
the

rouge
because
it
made
violent
retaliation
against
someone
of
means
is
a
reality
people
who
identify
with
the
ceo
are
scared

the
possibility
of
being
shot

for

you

mangione
is
definitely
highly
obssessed
with
his

i
highly
doubt
that
he
was
in
a
rational
state
of
mind
leading
up
to
the
culmination
of
his
fit
of
highly
wrought
angry
deed
more
than

personality
defect
or
probably
a
psychotic
latency
time
will
out
whichever
irrational
state
of
mind
drove
him
to
his
actions
simple
answer
he
was
part
of
the
elite
class
the
media
and
the
government
is
not
going
to
let
that
go
he
was
one
of
them
if
the
media
attention
raises
eyebrows
just
look
at
the
lengths
they
went
to
to
find
this
guy
you
don
t
see
that
when
a
banger
kills
a
family
in
nyc
you
don
t
see
that
when
someone
s
brutally
beaten
in
their
apartments
hell
remember
when
illegal
cartels
were
taking
over
buildings
in
this
country
we
heard
about
it
for
a
week
and
that
was
it
a
militant
force
armed
to
the
teeth
terrorizing
people
inside
this
damn
country
and
they
got
less
media
attention
than
this
ceo
just
saying
kinda
all
you
need
to
know
about
how
the
controlling
class
feels
about
the
peasants
of
this
nation
be
careful
what
you
wish
for
do
you
really
want
to
live
in
a
ny
known
for
condoning
being
shot
in
the
back
based
on
a
wannabe
assassin
s
interpretation
of
worth
it
s
not
just
whether
you
would
be
a
target
but
what
the
second
order
consequences
would
be
of
flight
of
capital
events
and
tourism
acts
of
terrorism
is
becoming
more
accepted
in
the
sociopolitical
climate
increasingly
on
the
left
probably
gonna
get
worse
i
ve
stopped
watching
monitoring
news
earlier
this
year
and
i
feel
much
better
about
it
generally
the
sensationalism
of
everything
is
nauseating
and
drives
too
much
anxiety
for
me
so
i
ve
started
just
reading
the
morning
headlines
once
a
day
and
maybe
checking
evening
headlines
before
bed
i
would
encourage
everyone
to
take
a
media
diet
and
scale
it
back
they
re
not
looking
to
inform
as
much
as
influence
and
protect
their
own
interests
the
obsession
from
media
around
this
situation
is
the
latest
and
very
real
example
deleted
it
s
probably
because
he
is
handsome
people
know
his
name
and
his
life
because
of
all
the
attention
i
don
t
believe
i
even
know
the
name
of
the
trump
shooter
or
his
whole
backstory
motive
dumb
people
are
happy
to
see
a
rich
white
person
get
murdered
2
wasn
t
know
until
later
in
the
story
when
it
was
already
very
popular
now
it
s
just
gasoline
on
a
bonfire
your
specifics
are
off
but
i
think
your
reasoning
isn
t
entirely
yes
lots
of
people
get
killed
all
across
this
country
to
little
fanfare
and
few
fucks
given
but
very
very
few
of
them
are
a
brazen
targeted
assassination
in
the
middle
of
a
busy
city
most
murders
are
either
personal
drama
that
explodes
the
cheating
wife
the
abusive
husband
the
parents
that
took
away
your
videogames
or
they
re
crimes
of
opportunity
that
or
accidental
in
nature
a
robbery
gone
bad
a
stay
bullet
hitting
a
bystander
or
they
re
connected
to
crime
and
perpetrated
by
and
against
criminals
these
are
all
either
completely
mundane
or
else
happen
to
people
we
don
t
care
about
this
though
is
different
in
a
big
way
different
is
interesting
and
interesting
sells
newspapers
then
throw
in
the
politics
of
it
all
and
you
ve
basically
got
a
gold
mine
if
all
you
care
about
is
selling
eyeballs
there
is
absolutely
no
reason
that
a
rich
kid
should
be
frustrated
with
the
health
insurance
system
as
his
family
could
have
paid
for
all
his
medical
needs
out
of
pocket
middle
to
lower
class
exactly
this
sad
to
say
when
one
of
their
elites
gets
assassinated
it
changes
the
ball
game
when
the
controlling
class
is
directly
effected
yup
shoot
up
a
school
and
you

that

there
is
sort

killer

that
s
so
silly
there
are
so
many
other
high
profile
murders
where
the
victim
is
not

and
every

every

a
kid
was
murdered
in
nyc
for
looking
like
an
immigrant
right
after
the
ceo
and
there
s
been
no
media
attention
and
the
nypd
hasn
t
seemed
to
give
a
damn
the
story
drove
clicks
and
views
which
drove
the
media
to
obsess
over
it
there
was
an
easy
compelling
story
to
tell
people
who
supported
the
perpetrator
would
watch
to
cheer
their
hero
on
their
robbinhood
people
who
found
those
supporters
disgusting
would
also
watch
to
shake
their
fists
at
the
air
and
feel
supported
the
worlds
gone
to
hell
once
the
media
is
obsessed
the
police
must
act
so
they
don
t
look
like
fools
a
great
tool
to
get
any
level
of
government
moving
is
heavy
media
involvement
especially
if
you
can
turn
your
story
into
a
great
narrative
yup
welcome
to
the
world
where
the
ruling
class
is
protected
at
all
costs
this
is
exactly
the
kind
of
behavior
that
got
the
ceo
killed
in
the
first
place
and
more
of
it
will
happen
as
they
try
to
maintain
the
status
quo
the
nypd
is
run
by
a
member
of
an
aristocratic
family
that
owns
the
ny
giants
some
cases
just
gets
more
attention
obviously
a
ceo
getting
murdered
is
going
to
get
more
attention
than
some
random
person
remember
that
case
of
some
young
white
girl
went
missing
and
they
found
dozens
of
bodies
but
they
were
trying
to
find
her
why
are
there
tens
of
thousands
of
reddit
posts
on
this
guy
but
when
a
gang
member
gets
shot
and
killed
we
are
all
silent
going
to
be
pedantic
but
he
was
far
from
a
billionaire
43
mil
net
worth
where
are
you
seeing
he
was
a
billionaire
most
ceos
are
not
billionaires
unless
they
are
also
founders
of
the
company
wasn
t
a
billionaire
or
even
close
why
do
people
keep
saying
that
does
it
make
you
feel
better
about
him
being
murdered
wouldn
t
that
money
not
transfer
when
he
gets
extradited
to
ny
why
would
you
send
him
money
he
still
committed
murder
and
he
s
rich
as
fuck
donating
money
to
the
top
1
because
they
murdered
someone
ummm
except
one
health
insurer
walked
back
their
decision
to
not
pay
for
anesthesia
for
the
entire
surgery
so
it
kind
of
did
work
no
did
your
last
sentence
really
happen
gotta
say
i
m
way
more
afraid
of
the
consequences
of
not
offering
better
housing
and
mental
health
resources
than
migrants
living
in
ny
every
day
all
i
see
is
migrants
selling
candy
but
i
have
been
assaulted
or
nearly
assaulted
by
homeless
mentally
ill
people
multiple
times
this
year
alone
two
weeks
ago
huge
ass
mentally
ill
homeless
man
suddenly
kissed
me
and
then
stood
and
glared
at
me
as
if
daring
me
to
say
anything
about
it
earlier
this
year
a
lady
chased
me
screaming
through
several
train
carts
because
she
thought
i
moved
carts
to
follow
her
and
only
after
she
kicked
me
by
a
door
did
it
click
in
her
head
that
she
was
mistaken
i
also
saw
a
mentally
ill
man
walk
up
to
another
man
and
punch
him
dead
in
the
face
for
absolutely
no
discernable
reason
but
the
cops
stay
outside
the
trains
working
hard
by
catching
people
who
avoid
paying
fare
you
got
source
on
that
200
400
people
claim
disagree
this
picked
up
steam
before
we
even
saw
his
face
americans
are
terrified
about
dealing
with
health
insurance
companies
when
an
emergency
happens
i
wouldn
t
call
people
who
live
through
chronic
pain
or
have
witnessed
the
death
of
a
loved
one
due
to
lack
of
medical
coverage
as
dumb
thank
you
for
your
insight
the
post
you
responded
to
isn
t
entirely
accurate
and
obviously
has
some
bias
in
their
assessment
i
think
one
of
the
important
elements
of
this
whole
thing
was
the
audacious
manner
in
which
the
ceo
was
executed
it
s
not
as
you
state
a
clear
crime
of
passion
or
accident
which
tends
to
be
more
common
the
second
more
obvious
component
is
the
target
someone
who
no
doubt
has
built
up
quite
a
target
on
his
back
due
to
the
policies
of
his
company
that
has
killed
quite
a
few
people
of
their
own
two
birds
with
one
stone
your
confusing
upper
class
with
ruling
class
i
hope
someday
in
my
lifetime
i
get
to
see
someone
with
balls
completely
get
rid
of
the
nypd
and
start
over
yeah
this
is
my
take
too
it
s
not
about
class
as
a
media
consumer
i
m
also
much
more
interested
in
this
case
than
other
shootings
which
took
years
not
a
week
missing
white
female
syndrome
a
white
female
goes
missing
gets
reported
on
news
and
add
a
non
white
suspect
for
ragebait
a
non
white
female
goes
missing
crickets
that
s
inaccurate
but
he
s
not
a
billionaire
from
what
i
see
that
s
the
value
of
his
united
stock
so
there
s
also
his
salary
of
10
mil
a
year
and
options
plus
whatever
else
he
owns
it
s
not
pedantic
when
idiots
keep
spouting
off
how
he
was
a
billionaire
when
he
was
closer
to
being
broke
than
he
was
a
billionaire
not
really
i
think
folks
are
just
happy
that
people
doing
shitty
things
to
others
are
reaping
what
they
sow
yeah
my
uncle
is
going
into
some
pretty
intensive
surgery
this
february
it
has
been
an
absolute
emotional
rollercoaster
for
our
family
since
the
announcement
that
his
anesthesia
wouldn
t
be
covered
if
the
doctors
went
overtime
especially
when
the
time
limit
is
designed
my
insurance
companies
followed
by
relief
when
they
reversed
said
decision
my
uncle
and
his
family
did
everything
right
they
saved
their
money
and
worked
hard
for
the
increasingly
unattainable
american
middle
class
life
and
for
this
they
are
the
most
vulnerable
to
health
insurance
companies
bleeding
them
financially
objectively
he
helped
my
family
very
unpopular
to
point
this
out
but
that
change
was
a
good
change
it
s
already
a
policy
in
place
and
enforced
by
medicare
and
the
end
result
is
not
that
patients
pay
ridiculous
out
of
pocket
costs
or
have
anesthesia
cut
off
the
result
is
that
there
is
less
fraud
from
anesthesiologists
and
there
is
less
over
billing
anesthesiologists
are
some
of
the
worst
actors
in
medicine
they
make
huge
salaries
and
many
systemically
over
bill

providing

what

does
and
what

s
what
they

the

article
that
people
took

the
sole
change
would
be
that
anesthesiologists
and
specifically
the
worst

ones
would
make
less
money
that
was
what
was
at

and
it
s
a
good
case
study
for
why
mob

is
not
great
i
don
t
doubt
they
rolled
it
back
because
there
was
an
angry
mob
going
ballistic
about
it
but
the
end
result
is
higher
cost
of

and
more

fraud

right
but
the
killing
of
this
ceo
isn
t
going
to
change
or
fix
the
problem
so
bit
even
close
to
being
a
billionaire
glad
to
hear
it
worked
out
for
you
the
system
is
busted
but
murdering
ceos
while
crowd
pleasing
isn
t
going
to
actually
fix
anything
if
someone
told
you
that
your
uncle
s
anesthesiology
was
at
risk
of
not
being
covered
they
flat
out
lied
to
you
it
was
a
lie
i
m
not
confused
they
weren
t
confused
if
someone
told
you
this
they
were
lying
to
you
the
policy
you
re
concerned
about
is
already
in
place
nationwide
for
every
person
covered
under
medicare
and
none
of
the
scare
tactic
things
that
were
spread
a
week
ago
happen
for
a
medicare
patient
who
this
policy
applies
to
here
s
what
happens
when
the
surgery
goes
over
time
all
the
care
remains
the
same
and
the
anesthesiologist
makes
less
money
that
s
it
that
s
all
that
happens
it
is
illegal
for
the
anesthesiologist
to
bill
you
the
difference
it
is
illegal
for
them
to
wake
you
up
and
leave
it
is
illegal
for
them
to
go
out
of
network
when
the
hospital
is
in
network
now
of
course
these
things
are
illegal
only
because
anesthesiologists
some
of
the
highest
compensated
doctors
in
medicine
would
pull
that
shit
all
the
time
before
it
was
outlawed
but
all
the
scare
shit
you
read
about
was
just
from
the
anesthesiologists
lobbying
union
terrified
they
would
be
making
less
money
the
issue
with
mob
rule
is
that
it
s
not
effective
mobs
believe
stupid
shit
all
the
time
this
is
a
good
example
this
is
a
policy
that
is
already
in
place
for
the
single
biggest
insurer
in
the
country
which
is
state
run
if
the
policy
is
veto
by
murder
the
people
murdering
get
to
set
the
policies
whether
they
are
right
or
wrong
but
that
s
literally
not
how
the
insurance
company
framed
it
they
didn
t
say
we
re
moving
to
a
flat
fee
model
and
those
are
just
the
homicides
not
even
the
manslaughters
accidents
accidents
disappearances
etc
thank
you
very
much
was
curious
since
those
numbers
were
fairly
specific
and
often
times
when
i
see
people
making
claims
about
my
city
it
s
usually
highly
hyperbolic
or
dead
wrong
ie
they
made
shit
up
this
looks
legit
what
about
the
migrants
shoving
people
into
subways
i
haven
t
seen
anything
regarding
that
claim
even
with
a
google
search
bcbs
reversed
and
clarified
their
new
anesthesia
policy
within
a
day
of
the
shooting
even
still
that
s
not
the
point
of
the
post
why
is
a
ceo
s
murder
more
important
than
any
other
murder
that
takes
place
in
this
country
every
day
we
know
the
ceos
name
but
i
m
certain
no
one
can
name
the
victims
of
the
buffalo
shooting
the
uvalde
shooting
or
the
newton
shooting
this
media
reaction
does
nothing
to
quell
the
bubbling
populist
sentiment
that
the
institutions
have
failed
and
should
be
destroyed
it

the

maybe
in
some
states
also
doctors
should
be
paid
cut
the
fat
from
administrators
and
insurance
executives
they
did
frame
it
that
way
the
articles
that
you
read
were
being
aggregated
from
the
anesthesiologists
lobbyist
group
that
released
a
publication
reframing
how
the
insurance
company
framed
it
if
you
disagree
you
can
share
the
source
you
re
thinking
of
and
we
can
look
at
it
together
everything
always
works
in
france
the
entire
population
is
subsidized
by
the
govt
terrific
lol
until
the
bill
comes
due
yes
that
is
exactly
what
i
m
talking
about
the
link
you
shared
is
a
publication
from
the
american
society
of
anesthesiologists
a
group
that
lobbies
on
behalf
of
anesthesiologists
this
publication
specifically
was
a
death
panels
style
lie
in
order
to
publicly
pressure
the
insurance
companies
to
not
make
a
move
which
would
pay
the
anesthesiologists
less
this
in
particular
was
a
lie
intended
to
scare
you
and
the
point
that
this
is
already
in
place
with
medicare
is
not
to
say
that
your
uncle
has
medicare
it
s
to
point
out
that
all
the
stuff
that
the
anesthesiologists
are
falsely
claiming
will
happen
is
not
happening
even
though
the
biggest
single
insurer
in
the
country
already
has
this
policy
what
actually
happened
here
is
that
public
researchers
identified
that
anesthesiologists
were
over
billing
patients
medicare
acted
immediately
to
crack
down
on
them
but
when
bcbs
moved
to
match
that
for
their
patients
anesthesiologists
mobilized
to
protect
their
profits
this
group
of
anesthesiologists
wrote
an
article
intended
to
scare
you
to
protect
an
insanely
lucrative
racket
that
they
currently
have
running
with
many
private
insurers
and
it
worked
you
and
your
family
were
very
scared
but
they
were
lying
and
some
less
savory
media
outlets
covered
their
lies
like
they
were
facts
it
could
not
be
any
more
similar
to
the
death
panels
lie
that
insurance
companies
told
to
kill
the
public
option
just
a
pure
scare
tactic
being
spread
to
maintain
the
status
quo
for
people
who
make
insane
money
from
it
no
it
is
federally
illegal
now
to
balance
bill
the
fat
in
american
healthcare
is
nearly
all
what
we
pay
for
the
services
themselves
not
the
insurance
an
anesthesiologist
in
denmark
makes
a
starting
salary
of
about
120k
euros
in
america
it
s
3x
higher
for
comparison
insurance
companies
make
6
profit
margins
meaning
going
to
a
profit
less
system
will
cut
costs
6
but
that
s
not
really
what
people
are
typically
thinking
of
yes
you
are
correct
it
is
illegal
for
physicians
to
bill
for
anything
else
other
than
what
insurance
companies
reimburse
it
is
in
their
contracts
also
explain
to
me
how
the
incentives
work
if
doctors
make
less
money
on
long
surgeries
will
doctors
stay
and
put
in
the
time
for
free
or
will
they
hurry
to
finish
up
i
m
a
lawyer
and
our
billable
requirement
is
2k
guess
how
many
people
bill
juuuuust
above
2k
even
if
there
is
more
work
to
do
that
year
i
m
talking
about
the
french
revolution
do
you
have
a

the
average
salary
for

how

how

makes

above
what
is
considered
low
income
for

person
it
s
gross
the
fat
is
unequivocally
the
health
insurance
industry
i
don
t
know
who
you
think
you
are
fooling
united
healthcare
s
revenue
in
2023
was
226
6
billion
and
that
is
just
one
of
many
american
health
insurance
companies
that
s
right
the
thing
that
you
are
describing
that
lawyers
do
is
exactly
what
the
the
researchers
published
in
jama
noticed
that
the
anesthesiologists
were
doing
rounding
up
and
exaggerating
their
equivalent
of
billable
hours
to
charge
higher
amounts
this
was
systemic
with
many
anesthesiologists
consistently
rounding
up
in
ways
that
were
more
normally
distributed
among
the
majority
what
the
anesthesiologists
are
trying
to
freak
you
out
with
is
the
b
b
b
b
but
what
if
they
have
incentive
to
rush
me
but
this
policy
is
already
in
place
with
the
nation
s
largest
insurer
medicare
and
none
of
this
bad
stuff
happens
what
we
know
for
a
fact
happens
is
the
billable
hours
phenomenon
where
some
anesthesiologists
typically
correlating
with
the
highest
compensated
anesthesiologists
are
systemically
inflating
their
billable
hours
oh
yeah
then
the
us
revolution
also
worked
but
those
weren
t
to
fix
health
care
a
source
for
what
that
the
article
you
posted
is
from
the
asa
you
posted
that
source
lol
here
s
a
jama
article
describing
the
phenomenon
that
medicare
cracked
down
on
and
bcbs
tried
to
crack
down
on
note
that
the
over
billing
also
tended
to
correlate
with
the
highest
compensated
anesthesiologists

what
to

for
you
that
medicare
already

this

s
maybe
a

to
the
actual
work
time
study
that
medicare
uses
and
that
bcbs
was
going
to

and
that
the

was

f
the
median
salaries
in
denmark
on
average
are
very
close
to
the
us
depending
on
how
you
measure
within
10
that
s
why
i
picked
denmark
anesthesiologists
make
less
everywhere
even
adjusting
for
differences
in
incomes
but
denmark
is
a
good
one
because
they
are
single
payer
are
considered
a
model
healthcare
system
and
have
reasonably
similar
salaries
to
the
us
elsewhere
i
m
not
lying
to
you
or
trying
to
mislead
you
what
happened
here
is
very
straightforward
the
anesthesiologists
trade
union
was
worried
that
they
would
make
less
money
and
so
they
lied
and
tried
to
drum
up
a
panic
to
publicly
pressure
the
insurance
companies
to
reverse
course
this
worked
that
s
all
lol
at
thinking
people
on
medicare
receive
quality
care
the
way
to
fix
overbilljng
is
with
oversight
time
stamps
can
easily
be
pulled
from
badge
records
you
don
t
artificially
cap
fees
if
you
want
good
service
just
ask
insurance
defense
lawyers
fixing
rich
people
is
a
good
start
it
seems
like
salaries
in
denmark
cluster
around
the
middle
high
income
folks
make
less
low
income
folks
make
more
than
in
the
us
so
average
isn
t
a
good
comparator
we
need
to
compare
high
income
to
high
income
also
what
about
debt
from
med
school
there
are
a
lot
of
factors
but
in
average
doctors
make
far
far
less
now
than
they
did
say
40
years
ago
a
tech
bro
shouldn
t
make
more
than
pcp
but
they
do
our
policies
should
cut
waste
not
salaries
for
doctors
who
gave
up
ten
years
of
their
lives
to
learn
their
craft
here
s
a
horrific
thing
that
is
true
ok
it
s
not
true
but
they
explained
it
bad
ok
they
didn
t
explain
it
bad
but
the
incentives
are
bad
ok
the
incentives
are
already
bad
but
i
have
a
better
solution
to
this
problem
that
i
claimed
didn
t
exist
30
minutes
ago
this
type
of
conversation
is
exhausting
the
doctors
are
fucking
lying
these
types
of
conversations
are
insane
i
have
a
better
idea
for
how
to
eliminate
fraud
is
a
far
cry
from
what
the
above
poster
thought
was
the
issue
so
why
fucking
lie
and
mislead
people
about
it
talking
about
pcps
is
fucking
crazy
sure
whatever
but
that
has
nothing
to
do
with
this
you
cannot
have
denmark
s
healthcare
at
denmark
s
cost
and
then
pay
the
specialists
3x
as
much
as
they
are
paid
in
denmark
if
your
reaction
to
someone
trying
to
stop
a
500k
per
year
annual
specialist
from
defrauding
the
system
is
no
then
there
is
no
affordable
healthcare
system
that
we
can
achieve
you
simply
cannot
pay
doctors
this
much
and
have
affordable
care
that
s
the
disconnect
here
it
s
the
dril
candles
tweet
the
specialists
make
3
4x
what
they
make
in
other
countries
that
s
where
the
cost
is
coming
from
it
s
not
coming
from
insurance
companies
eliminating
their
profit
would
save
5
10
is
your
feeling
that
us
healthcare
is
5
10
too
expensive
weird
how
things
can
be
bad
in
many
different
ways
lol
i
m
fine
paying
anesthesiologists
what
they
are
worth
if
fraud
is
a
problem
there
are
better
ways
to
address
it
your
position
that
insurance
hospital
administration
etc
etc
only
add
5
10
is
hilarious
lol
what
insurance
company
you
work
for
bro
i
love
the
angle
of
blaming
doctors
for
making
too
much
when
reimbursement
has
been
decreasing
for
all
specialties
across
the
board
year
after
year

and
as
much
as

say
it
so
valuable
for
the
holidays
ahead
please
be
good
to
yourself
everyone
you
deserve
it
and
are
worth
it
where
were
you
when
i
did
my
own
sheep
a
few
years
ago
that
s
such
a
tough
job
so
greasy
goats
are
way
easier
are
you

done
a

myself
raised

years
along

for
those
asking
you
don

if
you
re

i
hated
doing

lol
don
t
think
you
need
a

for
what
the
op
is
doing
where
do
you
live
in
vt
go
to
your
local
library
join
see
what
s
going
on
in
your
town
that
s
my
best
advice
good
luck
hey
there
i
m
not
in
the
same
area
as
you
but
i
thought
that
i
would
lend
a
hand
and
try
and
help
you
refine
your
personal
ad
a
bit
for
example
what
kind
of
video
games
are
you
into
pc
console
what
s
your
all
time
favorite
how
about
a
naming
of
few
of
the
shows
or
books
that
flip
your
pancake
what
sort
of
person
are
you
like
beyond
some
of
the
things
that
interest
you
got
any
ideas
in
mind
for
friend
activities
that
you
might
be
into
or
keen
to
check
out
anyway
a
bit
more
info
might
catch
the
attention
of
the
right
person
people
good
luck
with
the
hunt
have
you
started
wind
and
truth
i
have
struggled
to
make
friends
since
moving
to
vermont
2
years
ago
i
live
outside
of
rutland
i
ve
been
playing
ff7
rebirth
when
i
have
time
i
also
enjoy
board
games
like
settlers
of
catan
or
dead
of
winter
i
like
to
snowboard
at
pico
sad
to
see
this
rain
washing
away
all
the
fresh
snow
we
got
and
kayak
in
the
summertime
this
is
definitely
a
common
experience
in
vt
you
re
not
alone
my
friend
i
would
recommend
bumble
bff
great
app
for
meeting
people
in
your
area
i
also
need
friends
in
vt
but
i
live
in
rutland
where
about
in
addison
county
join
a
volunteer
fire
dept
i
ve
had
luck
meeting
friends
in
the
following
areas
1
martial
arts
in
bjj
in
particular
2
music
i
m
in
a
band
3
outdoors
stuff
cross
country
skiing
and
sailing
other
than
that
the
usual
some
of
my
friends
are
neighbours
some
i
know
from
work
yes
this
is
a
vital
question
post
flair
says
addison
county
this
is
my
advice
as
well
libraries
are
always
a
safe
place
in
my
opinion
your
metaphor
about
pancakes
really
flips
my
pancake
journey
before
destination
brother
i
moved
to
vt
and
am
struggling
to
find
friends
to
hang
out
with
i
too
enjoy
games
but
have
been
playing
bo6
i
also
enjoy
catan
and
board
at
pico
all
this
rain
is
washing
the
snow
away
would
it
be
presumptuous
to
tell
you
what
french
s
my
toast
thank
you
those
winds
to
our
east
are
impressive
my
mom
has
been
displaced
for
two
months
and
is
just
about
done
with
repairs
to
make
the
house
livable
again
hoping
for
the
best
do
you
have
a
link
for
the
real
time
source
of
your
first
visual
thank
you
things
look
to
have
shifted
slightly
east
as
of
the
latest
nws
which
is
a
tad
better
for
western
west
central
vt
but
man
nh
and
evt
and
svt
svt
has
quite
a
bit
more
snow
in
the
mountains
than
nvt
and
is
going
to
be
warmer
which
isn
t
going
to
help
are
going
to
be
iffy
hopefully
everyone
stays
safe
tldr
version
roads
are
going
to
icy
slow
down
be
prepared
and
best
of
all
don
t
go
out
if
you
re
on
high
ground
you
pay
every
year
if
you
re
in
the
lowlands
you
pay
from
time
to
time
im
new
to
storms
in
the
east
what
do
we
do
if
it
floods
where
do
we
go
with
our
animals
what
do
we
do
with
our
cars
those
images
don
t
translate
to
the
app
i
e
i
can
t
click
on
them
to
zoom
so
it
s
difficult
to
see
what
they
are
trying
to
show

i
can
t
click
on
any
of
them
is
the
issue
well
at
least
the
drought
and
fire
risk
is
low
if
you
live
in
a
flood
zone
have
rebuilt
and
are
now
complaining
about
the
potential
scenario
for
this
storm
you
need
to
look
in
the
mirror
and
ask
yourself
some
serious
questions
maybe
put
lipstick
on
to
the
sweet
sounds
of
david
bowie
thankfully
they
are
the
max
gusts
but
they
are
still
quite
strong
sustained
winds
will
be
much
less
but
the
gusts
will
cause
damage
hopefully
this
works

q
it
s
supposed
to
be
55
degrees
tomorrow
in
se
vt
i
wouldn
t
say
don
t
go
out
the
ice
is
the
least
of
the
worries
with
this
storm
flooding
is
the
1
concern
you
might
want
to
edit
your
tldr
to
include
flooding
it
seems
to
be
the
main
concern
from
reading
the
whole
post
and
what
i
m
seeing
from
other
news
sources
everybody
should
look
up
the
weather
for
their
zip
code
or
usual
routes
and
pay
special
attention
to
the
flood
warnings
because
the
snowpack
rain
in
the
winter
can
be
as
bad
as
spring
flooding
alternative
tldr
option
go
google
your
zip
weather
because
of
possible
flooding
ice
etc
and
don
t
be
a
dummy
that
needs
to
be
rescued
the
national
weather
service
has
forecast
1
5
to
2
5
inches
of
rain
but
it
s
the
combination
of
rain
and
snowmelt
that
has
forecasters

of

for
most
of
vermont
on
wednesday
really
i
d
say
the
opposite
i
m
not
sure
about
where
you
live
but
where
i
live
the
town
or
city
usually
opens
up
a
temporary
shelter
cars
can
be
replaced
animals
are
usually
allowed
at
shelters
if
you
are
not
near
any
major
river
or
stream
i
wouldn
t
worry
to
much
local
authorities
will
tell
you
otherwise
though
on
an
emergency
depending
on
your
county
you
may
have
a
disaster
animal
respond
team
that
sets
up
a
shelter
this
usually
only
happens
if
the
town
is
setting
up
and
shelter
central
vermont
usually
sets
up
in

you
can
go

pinch

it
works
just
fine
for

on

yup
not
great
there
55
and
more
rain
if
you
don
t
need
to
go
out
don
t
go
out
it
s
really
that
simple
most
every
person
who
gets
stuck
run
off
the
road
flipped
or
ran
into
a

is
often
out
and
about
doing
something
they
didn
t
need
to
do
getting
cigarettes
weed
alcohol
last
minute
groceries
etc
if
you
need
to
evacuate
because
of
flooding
that
s
a
totally
different
story
and
doesn
t
fall
into
the
realm
of
don
t
need
to
go
out
lol
view

some
people
pay
up
to

how
do
i
know
how
do
i
keep
up
with
the
notifications
of
my
tiny
town
lol
yeah
they
aren
t
clickable
for
me
ice
is
almost
non
existent
with
this
storm
for
most
a
very
light
glaze
should
form
on
dirt
roads
and
trees
it
will
twinkle
in
the
light
but
nothing
else
i
don
t
want
to
tell
people
to
stay
home
due
to
ice
that
is
not
severe
or
bad
if
you
go
slow
on
the
roads
you
will
be
fine
speeding
is
what
causes
people
to
lose
control
when
the
roads
are
lightly
slippery
or
summer
tires
after
the
storm
it
will
freeze
for
some
so
it
will
be
bad
in
areas
that
have
a
lot
of
standing
water
nothing
some

im
going

i
thought
you

sign

vershire
these
make
the
90s
look
like
the
70s
and
now
i
feel
100
years
old
looks
like
a
postcard
from
a
simpler
time
nostalgia
overload
i
d
much
rather
have
the
snow
than
the
rain
coming
the
snow
rain
cycle
is
just
so
difficult
shoveling
to
the
greenhouse
compost
and
chickens
is
impossible
when
there
s
rain
involved
back
when
we
got
serious
snow
would
love
to
see
some
pics
from
the
blizzard
of
78
i
was
young
but
i
remember
the
snow
being
as
high
as
the
front
door
and
having
to
dig
out
stunning
this
is
a
vibe
when
it
was
good
yea
october
s
used
to
be
rough
i
swear
we
got
more
snow
15
20
years
ago
maybe
because
i
was
smaller
i
thought
there
was
more
lol
why
does
the
90
s
look
and
feel
like
the
60
s
now
op
was
this
a
house
in
ripton
i
am
tearing
up
this
brought
me
back
holy
shit
we
all
had
one
didn
t
we
while
i
never
had
one
i
chuckled
at
the
car
sized
satellite
dish
maybe
partly
because
you
can
still
see
some
old
rusty
ones
around
here
long
after
they
stopped
working
beautiful
oh
hey
we
might
have
gone
to
school
together
if
you
had
kids
who
were
teenagers
around
this
time
we
were
probably
classmates
no
longer
the
pix
are
boring
because
all
you
see
is
fluffy
white
stuff
s
there
was
there
was
much
more
snow
back
then
to
be
honest
i
m
not
exactly
sure
it
was
my
grandparents
house
i
just
found
these
old
photos
they
sent
us
and
we
all
stole
premium
channels
from
canada
for
free
because
the
signal
is
on
our
property
and
nothing
was
encrypted
at
the
time
just
need
to
move
the
dish
enough
d
i
never
got
one
until
like
2005
until
then
it
was
basic
cable
with
10
channels
my
family
did
too
chelsea
class
of
2002
not
as
much
no
there
s
a
house
just
south
out
of
town
in
hinesburg
that
has
a
similar
hill
overlook
and
used
to
have
farm
animals
in
front
before
it
was
remodeled
probably
isn
t
the
same
one
but
reminds
me
of
it
one
time
in
the
winter
when
i
drove
by
there
was
a
bon
fire
in
the
field
and
several
cows
were
standing
next
to
it
for
warmth
dang
guess
not
i
was
at
rivendell
a
lot
of
my
classmates
were
from
vershire
well
howdy
anyway
thanks

why
the

because

aren

we

another
successful

for

tire

the
i
m

club
also
met
that
day
but
hopefully
their
membership
will
get
smaller
as
winter
progresses
in
fairness
vtrans
should
keep
their
eye
on
the
forecast
too
because
they
were
underprepared
on
monday
i
was
on
the
roads
for
an
hour
and
didn
t
see
a
single
truck
or
salted
plowed
road
if
the
vehicle
inspection
program
was
designed
for
safety
it
would
ensure
folks
had
safe
and
adequate
tires
for
winter
the
single
largest
driver
of
accidents
in
the
state
how
many
of
those
cars
that
slid
off
the
highway
had
rusty
rear
rotors
that
we
commonly
fail
cars
for
that
is
not
directly
linked
in
any
data
to
accidents
well
89
was
horrendous
the
plows
were
definitely
behind
for
that
evening
rush
hour
traffic
especially
north
bound
from

idk
driving
still
feels
dodgy

me
and
i

meh
just
throw
all
the

out
and
watch
the

they

why

up

you

we

since
they
did
i
ll
fairly
criticize
the

conditions
in

you
can
drive
responsibly
and
still
have
the
opinion
that
the

were
below

for
the

great
now
fix

which
are

the

would

if
they

rents
i
ve
lived
in
areas
where
housing
was
expanded
but
infrastructure
was
not
it
doesn
t
end
well
they
need
to
be
tied
but
once
development
regulations
are
lessened
it
s
a
run
away
train
this
is
awesome
now
let
s
tackle
lawsuits
and
small
numbers
of
neighbors
halting
projects
proposals
for
reforming
how
neighbors
can
challenge
new
housing
a
key
issue
at
both
the
local
and
state
permitting
levels
in
vermont
largely
did
not
make
it
to
the
finish
line
last
legislative
session
development
of
farmworker
housing
is
needed
to
improve
housing
supply
and
provide
affordable
housing
for
farmers
and
farmworkers
who
need
a
home
to
continue
growing
food
for
our
communities
and
beyond
sad
to
see
it
where
i
m
located
went
from
a
lot
of
farm
land
to
mostly
condo
complexes
apartments
over
the
past
10
years
what
s
to
stop
these
from
being
airbnb
remote
worker
housing
too
bad
the
developers
will
only
build
450
000
three
bedroom
homes
act
250
isn
t
the
real
problem
it
s
all
the
permits
combined
there
s
local
zoning
which
varies
by
town
depending
on
the
town
that
can
be
the
more
difficult
hurdle
even
over
act
250
then
you
have
state
permits
on
top
of
local
so
wastewater
stormwater
and
potentially
construction
stormwater
water
supply
army
corps
wetlands
streams
etc
all
these
add
up
act
250
is
not
really
all
that
difficult
you
are
required
to
satisfy
these
other
permits
regardless
of
act
250
in
the
event
act
250
is
triggered
usually
all
everything
else
is
already
satisfied
it
just
becomes
a
formality
ive
done
permitting
in
vt
and
ny
ny
the
permit
process
is
much
more
straight
forward
there
is
less
duplicated
review
housing
is
lighting
a
cigarette
and
asking
if
i
can
bring
it
a
cold
glass
of
water
knees
weak
developers
don
t
make
much
money
building
smaller
homes
and
the
government
doesn
t
subsidize
market
rate
construction
so
there
s
no
incentives
for
them
to
build
them
despite
demand
the
on
top
of
that
some
municipalities
have
large
minimum
lot
size
requirements
making
constructing
smaller
homes
impossible
the
difference
is
remarkable
when
you
cross
the
border
to
make
money
in
construction
you
need
economy
of
scale
that
means
building
one
really
big
house
or
lots
of
small
houses
all
of
which
are
variations
on
a
few
basic
models
and
all
of
which
are
grouped
somewhat
closely
together
in
other
words
a
subdivision
between
act
250
and
generalized
opposition
to
development
it
s
incredibly
difficult
to
get
approval
to
build
a
subdivision
of
starter
houses
here
why
battle
with
the
town
county
and
state
to
get
permits
approved
for
20
houses
on
one
acre
lots
when
you
can
build
one
house
on
a
20
acre
lot
because
no
one
has
any
money
here
to
build
small
homes
there
s
no
economy
taxes
and
regulations
are
extreme
it
s
one
of
the
most
hostile
states
in
the
entire
nation
for
small
businesses
and
entrepreneurship
there
are
no
laborers
to
build
because
pay
is
so
low
due
to
the
state
of
the
economy
try
having
something
simple
like
a
pre
fab
garage
put
in
it
will
take
you
probably
over
a
year
due
to
the
labor
shortage
so
people
look
at
that
and
decide
not
to
move
here
which
makes
the
tax
burden
higher
and
higher
on
the
population
that
lives
here
which
makes
more
move
away
which
increases
the
tax
burden
even
more
in
a
feed
back
loop
this
is
all
by
design
rich
liberals
want
and
have
vermont
as
sort
of
a
little
east
coast
switzerland
that
is
insular
isolated
and
exclusive
for
people
with
a
lot
of
money
a
lot
of
people
mention
permitting
and
labor
which
are
both
serious
problems
however
a
developer
told
me
they
are
absolutely
beholden
to
financing
models
that
are
governed
by
banking
markets
recent
real
estate
finance
history
had
a
big
financial
crisis
in
which
a
condo
glut
became
a
huge
loss
for
the
industry
banking
is
a
national
system
and
they
see
investing
in
small
properties
as
risky
the
houses
that
are
being
built
and
sold
to
owners
in
vermont
are
median
price
and
up
everyone
else
is
being
corralled
into
the
commercial
renter
market
my
only
point
is
that
it
might
be
true
that
without
changing
the
banking
model
that
developers
operate
in
it
will
just
be
impossible
to
build
the
housing
that
people
without
homes
can
afford
to
own
fix
them
how
vermont
has
relatively
lax
zoning
laws
housing
doesn
t
exist
because
people
have
no
money
never
underestimate
a
rich
nimby
think
you
mean
workforce
quarters
there
boss
it
s
fun
using
the
acronym
nimby
but
a
lot
of
people
down
on
their
luck
are
pieces
of
shit
that
i
would
prefer
to
not
live
in
my
neighborhood
let
s
not
act
like
these
scumbags
would
be
great
people
if
they
had
money
while
this
may
be
true
i
would
argue
that
the
term
workforce
housing
suggests
that
these
units
were
not
built
to
be
luxury
apartments
they
were
probably
built
to
be
reasonably
sized
and
with
reasonable
standard
finishes
we
re
talking
carpeted
living
spaces
laminate
flooring
in
kitchen
bath
and
entryway
laminate
countertops
standard
appliances
and
baseboard
hot
water
heating
they
probably
have
standard
levels
of
insulation
contractor
grade
windows
and
will
not
break
any
records
in
terms
of
efficiency
they
probably
slightly
exceed
the
minimum
standard
affordable
housing
typically
means
subsidized
such
that
the
occupant
spends
no
more
than
30
of
their
agi
on
housing
that
can
vary
based
on
the
agi
of
the
family
the
developers
didn
t
really
claim
savings
a
little
bit
but
mainly
they
claimed
reduced
financial
risk
getting
an
act
250
permit
can
take
months
or
even
years
and
can
delay
or
stop
projects
either
increasing
project
costs
or
inning
the
risk
of
losing
all
the
design
and
permitting
fees
if
the
project
doesn
t
pass
workforce
housing
generally
means
1br
or
studio
units
for
usually
single
people
or
couples
that
are
trying
to
live
in
their
own
and
work
it
s
a
differentiation
from
family
housing
which

units
and
senior
housing
which
will
usually
have
a
higher
percentage
of
ada
units
and
a
few
other
services
it
is
an
important
distinction
you
are
correct
that
workforce
housing
does
not
mean
affordable
housing
though
often
workforce
housing
ends
up
getting
funded
through
the
lihtc
program
making
it
affordable
more
housing
and
houses
are
actually
a
bad
thing
ugh
i

the
homes
act
from
last
year
that
opened
up
zoning
to
allow
two
triplexes
the
homes
act
would
allow
and
here
is
where
my
specific
knowledge
isnt
perfect
4
housing
units
on
a
lot
where
before
perhaps
only
a
single
family
was
allowed
via
zoning
assuming
all
other
thresholds
are
met
water
sewer
parking
if
habitat
was
to
make
x
units
i
dont
know
what
x
is
after
the
homes
act
went
through
they
still
would
have
had
act250
to
contend
with
the
article
linked
would
now
make
it
easier
for
h4h
to
go
through
and
do
10
of
these
projects
without
having
to
do
the
additional
act
250
jump
if
they
were
doing
it
in
the
right
area
i
m
paying
2400
but
it
s
also
a
rural
3
bed
1
bath
house
love
where
we
are
no
one
complains
about
me
running
my
cnc
machine
planer
or
any
of
my
shop
tools
just
wish
i
had
a
concrete
floor
in
the
garage
and
insulation
of
course
not
our
legislators
are
those
very
neighbors
blocking
new
development
yeah
we
need
more
homelessness
and
less
workers
for
sure
really
though
is
anything
being
done
to
stop
short
term
rental
incentives
people
need
affordable
housing
i
didn
t
see
any
of
that
in
the
article
referenced
by
the
op
the
act
250
temp
exemptions
seem
to
exclude
those
the
developers
building
the
bigger
places
will
still
have
to
take
their
changes
with
act
250
it
is
really
not
too
bad
an
up
scale
home
will
clear
space
for
a
down
scale
home
more
housing
is
more
housing
full
stop
changing
the
balance
of
supply
demand
lowers
prices
for
everyone
and
makes
housing
more
affordable
to
those
that
need
it
that
s
cheaper
than
one
affordable
apartment
true
story
act
250
is
not
really
all
that
difficult
respectfully
every
single
developer
i
speak
to
has
not
agreed
with
this
sentiment
delays
are
costs
costs
are
risks
risks
kill
projects
there
are
numerous
projects
that
didn
t
make
it
in
the
past
few
years
because
they
were
at
risk
of
triggering
act
250
and
downsized
or
didnt
happen
regulation
is
important
to
ensuring
vermont
continues
to
exist
the
way
we
want
but
that
want
has
consequences
and
drives
costs
act
250
is
not
easy
or
a
formality
odd
that
the
op
s
referenced
article
suggested
a
lot
more
up
front
costs
by
the
developers
for
projects
that
would
be
subject
to
act
250
i
m
not
saying
you
re
wrong
since
i
have
no
experience
with
it
just
don
t
understand
the
need
for
these
new
temporary
exemptions
from
act
250
if
it
s
not
really
a
problem
just
gave
housing
a
good
time
eh
we
need
to
be
able
to
densify
our
existing
towns
and
cities
rowhouses
instead
of
just
plopping
down
suburban
sprawl
wherever
for
starters
ditch
parking
minimums
in
downtown
areas
in
towns
with
zoning
projects
to
build
houses
need
a
zoning
permit
as
well
in
fact
zoning
laws
apply
to
every
project
in
a
town
with
zoning
laws
while
act
250
only
applies
in
a
more
limited
number
of
situations
in
those
towns
and
a
lot
of
zoning
laws
suck
they
impose
things
like
employee
parking
requirements
on
small
local
businesses
with
no
employees
or
require
10
acre
lot
sizes
thus
creating
rural
sprawl
or
discourage
density
in
downtown
areas
that
should
be
developed
and
prohibit
building
on
slopes
of
more
than
a
certain
grade
so
if
you
thought
you
had
a
building
lot
on
your
property
that
you
could
use
for
your
kids
or
sell
think
again
many
of
them
were
developed
in
an
era
when
circumstances
were
different
and
many
of
them
are
written
by
interest
groups
rather
than
the
people
they
will
affect
some
of
the
regs
on
the
books
are
good
but
there
s
a
lot
of
chaff
and
because
most
towns
lack
the
resources
needed
to
adequately
review
and
mange
them
as
a
body
of
law
most
of
the
regs
that
get
enacted
stick
around
forever
join
your
local
planning
zoning
board
and
push
for
changes
unfortunately
no
one
is
here
to
learn
about
the
nuanced
nature
of
the
problems
facing
this
little
state
they
are
here
to
bitch
about
people
in
government
they
think
are
stupid
because
the
issues
get
presented
to
them
in
overly
broad
strokes
this
is
how
you
get
posters
like
the
guy
above
arguing
that
it
s
bad
to
prevent
people
from
building
housing
on
steep
grades
when
the
past
two
summers
have
seen
increasing
number
of
landslides
which
have
destroyed
homes

its
historic
summer
flooding
caused
an
unprecedented
number
of
landslides
in
vermont
it
is
fun
using
the
acronym
nimby
thank
you
however
i
think
you
re
confused
these
housing
units
aren
t
going
to
become
the
next
hotel
voucher
program
for
homeless
junkies
and
the
mentally
ill
these
aren
t
some
sort
of
safety
net
project
like
section
8
they
re
mostly
going
to
be
market
rate
rentals
with
some
affordable
units
built
in
you
must
think
that
affordable
means
free
but
it
doesn
t
it
means
subsidized
so
that
the
person
or
family
renting
the
unit
pays
no
more
than
30
of
their
adjusted
gross
income
on
housing
basically
that
means
families
who
make
approximately
the
median
vt
family
income
can
afford
to
live
in
these
units
the
vt
median
family
income
is
approximately
80k
year
i
think
that
s
a
far
cry
from
the
down
on
their
luck
pieces
of
shit
you
assume
will
be
able
to
move
in
rather
people
like
young
teachers
nurses
tradespeople
childcare
workers
etc
are
what
this
workforce
housing
will
cater
to
all
people
we
desperately
need
more
of
in
vermont
your
attitude
and
ignorance
are
perfect
exemplars
of
what
it
means
to
be
a
nimby
thank
you
for
the
useful
practical
illustration
ok
boomer
workforce
housing
is
for
people
who
are
middle
class
it
s
not
affordable
housing
workforce
housing
is
for
teachers
and
nurses
and
accountants
and
people
who
run
the
local
businesses
it
s
housing
for
normal
people
who
knew
i
ve
been
in
workforce
housing
with
my
family
for
20
years
to
bad
i
own
it
and
can
t
complain
about
a
landlord
lol
yeah
work
force
housing
sounds
like
these
buildings
will
be
shacks
that
will
be
rundown
in
5
years
because
the
slum
lords
will
not
maintain
the
properties
and
then
checks
notes
blame
the
work
force
wage
slaves
humanity
is
truly
one
of
the
species
of
all
time
oh
thanks
for
the
info
i
knew
it
was
due
to
some
law
change
recently
some
are
for
sure
some
want
very
much
to
do
all
they
can
to
end
the
housing
crisis
and
most
just
need
to
be
persuaded
imo
new
story
on
wcax
about
how
many
people
moved
here
from
out
of
state
last
year
even
pieciak
says
it
s
making
vermont
less
affordable
my
guess
is
these
new
builds
will
just
rent
to
remote
workers
that
s
fair
i
m
just
bitching
when
you
try
to
maximize
a
project
site
you
run
into
all
kinds
of
issues
you
are
only
allowed
to
build
to
the
zonings
maximum
lot
coverages
for
example
and
these
developers
push
right
up
to
the
edge
this
not
governed
by
act
250
doing
so
you
trigger
the
need
to
manage
stormwate
from
impervious
areas
and
if
you
are
maximizing
lot
coverage
it
becomes
trickier
to
place
the
treatment
areas
downsizing
eliminates
costs
and
efforts
of
engineering
if
you
are
building
and
project
that
pushes
the
limits
of
the
site
whether
you
have
act
250
or
not
is
not
the
problem
act
250
is
a
forever
burden
once
a
lot
has
act
250
every
change
from
building
additions
increased
impervious
use
changes
are
subject
to
review
getting
out
from
under
the
umbrella
is
a
good
thing
if
you
can
avoid
it
but
it
s
not
the
only
problem
with
permitting
this
state
has
like
i
said
regardless
of
act
250
you
are
still
subject
to
wastewater
potentially
water
supply
which
is
an
entirely
different
permit
operational
stormwater
for
new
impervious
construction
stormwater
for
disturbances
probably
need
wetlands
screening
bat
studies
etc
act
250
fees
are
also
factor
it
s
not
a
1
1
difficulty
to
review
based
on
cost
ive
worked
on
projects
that
trigger
the
maximum
act
250
fee
of
165k
and
the
effort
to
review
those
permits
at
times
are
way
easier
than
some
that
costs
1
10th
of
that
because
they
knew
they
needed
all
those
other
permits
and
signoffs
the
small
projects
often
don
t
or
try
to
cut
corners
my
impression
is
that
this
is
in
fact
what
the
act
250
reform
sought
to
do
not
sure
about
where
zoning
does
or
doesn
t
interfere
with
that
but
the
projects
described
in
the
digger
story
are
all
in
or
near
village
or
town
centers
yes
but
we
should
still
build
out
the
sprawl
some
of
us
need
housing
where
we
re
not
connected
to
our
neighbors
y
all
don
t
want
me
making
guitars
in
an
apartment
building
absolutely
minimum
parking
requirements
are
incredibly
destructive
im
curious
for
your
thoughts
here
i
have
no
specific
thoughts
if
a
given
area
is
vermont
urban
and
we
put
a
16
unit
complex
in
that
might
assume
somewhere
between
16
32
cars
are
going
to
exist
if
parking
is
not
required
where
do
those
cars
go
i
don
t
know
all
of
vermont
well
but
the
areas
where
16
units
could
be
built
and
not
have
space
for
parking
on
the
lot
seem
rather
limited
dropping
that
into
barre
rutland
winooski
burlington
etc
is
going
to
impact
on
street
parking
that
may
already
be
limited
can
you
share
your
thoughts
or
what
might
be
the
flaws
in
my
observation
whats
a
business
with
zero
emoloyees
that
i
get
i
mean
which
changes
id
rather
have
people
say
i
don
t
like
apartments
because
i
think
poor
people
live
in
them
then
try
to
jump
through
40
hoops
about
how
they
support
more
housing
just
not
within
30
miles
of
them
at
least
1
is
being
honest
and
it
s
easier
to
dismiss
them
it
s
a
shame
we
don
t
treat
public
safety
like
a
public
good
like
we
did
10
years
ago
and
instead
rely
on
exclusive
zoning
for
to
ensure
residents
safety
what
sort
of
tax
credits
goes
to
the
developers
that
build
a
couple
low
income
units
just
because
i
am
of
a
certain
age
doesn
t
negate
my
opinion
i
too
have
been
in
my
own
workforce
housing
for
the
past
15
years
when
we
built
our
house
we
prioritized
the
envelope
over
the
finishes
so
while
we
have
standard
vinyl
siding
unfinished
basement
carpeted
living
spaces
tile
in
the
kitchen
and
bathrooms
laminate
countertops
hot
water
baseboard
heat
and
no
central
air
we
did
add
extra
insulation
higher
performing
but
still
vinyl
windows
and
a
95
efficient
boiler
it
was
definitely
a
good
decision
honestly
totally
depends
that
s
what
artist
housing
is
for
i
would
be
so
down
to
have
neighbors
who
make
things
way
better
than
having
neighbors
who
run
a
leaf
blower
and
lawnmower
every
day
i
think
what
u
sudden
dragonfly2638
is
getting
at
is
that
a
zoning
change
to
remove
a
requirement
for
parking
minimums
in
a
downtown
area
will
put
selective
pressure
on
people
living
there
and
moving
there
to
1
get
rid
of
their
cars
trucks
suvs
2
use
public
transportation
3
walk
or
bike
4
use
ride
share
services
basically
to
reduce
the
dependence
on
motor
vehicles
reduce
the
number
of
such
vehicles
in
busier
downtowns
reduce
congestion
and
subsequently
reduce
pollution
i
think
in
a
place
like
vt
it
s
basically
a
pipe
dream
but
i
understand
the
notion
and
how
it
may
work
better
in
an
area
that
s
actually
urban
and
with
significant
population
i
think
what
they
meant
was
something
like
an
owner
operated
sole
proprietorship
with
no
additional
employees
beyond
the
owner
one
with
just
an
owner
who
runs
the
place
minimum
lot
sizes
mandatory
setbacks
height
limits
accessory
units
basically
things
that
allow
you
to
fit
more
houses
in
less
space
it
doesn
t
mandate
smaller
lots
just
allows
those
who
want
to
do
it
an
easier
time
insert
jerk
off
motion
here
artist
housing
not
sure
i
follow
but
i
can
almost
assure
you
it
would
not
give
me
access
to
the
power
requirements
i
need
for
my
equipment
nor
would
it
be
a
private
space
that
i
can
ensure
my
tools
equipment
and
projects
would
not
be
messed
with
i
ve
had
a
few
people
yell
at
me
for
being
pro
sprawl
and
i
get
it
but
we
need
housing
to
fit
the
bill
of
every
use
case
not
just
the
urban
city
centers
but
they
have
zero
clients
what
kind
of
business
is
that
and
once
you
zone
a
place
for
business
you
dont
have
control
over
what
type
what
is
the
next
business
going
to
be
but
no
one
goes
there
isn
t
that
just
working
from
home
my
best
friend
has
ahpuse
in
the
city
she
has
a
home
and
a
tint
little
nice
yard
they
recenty
changed
the
zoning
so
next
door
they
added
a
garage
with
an
apartment
on
top
it
filled
up
the
yard
next
door
and
now
she
gets
rivers
of
water
from
that
yard
that
fills
up
her
basement
cost
her
20k
to
put
a
sump
pump
in
zoning
should
be
a
huge
burden
on
the
people
that
live
in
a
town
zoning
should
make
new
decent
places
to
love
not
make
it
shitty
for
everyone
i
think
there
s
a
huge
gulf
between
having
some
low
density
housing
where
one
can
have
a
workshop
and
sprawl
i
m
a
woodworker
with
a
shop
and
i
ve
got
around
half
an
acre
on
the
outskirts
of
a
village
center
which
is
an
extremely
lucky
position
to
be
in
however
there
aren
t
all
that
many
people
who
need
woodshops
at
their
homes
and
that
shouldn
t
be
the
basis
for
widespread
policy
decisions
increasing
density
in
town
centers
means
the
existing
housing
in
rural
areas
will
be
less
in
demand
and
more
available
for
people
in
situations
like
yours
along
with
hillratch
s
comment
why
would
your
somewhat
specific
needs
require
a
new
building
instead
of
repurposing
an
existing
one
some
of
the
projects
in
the
op
link
are
to
convert
old
commercial
buildings
into
residential
housing
which
would
seem
perfect
for
your
needs
for
distant
neighbors
and
high
power
demand
does
your
guitar
making
have
to
be
done
in
a
building
on
pristine
land
i
m
sure
your
needs
are
unique
i
m
just
saying
i
ve
lived
around
lots
of
people
who
need
certain
things
to
do
what
they
love
and
the
assumption
that
no
one
wants
to
be
around
that
is
just
that
an
assumption
not
saying
you
don
t
deserve
whatever
living
situation
you
have
either
it
s
just
not
everyone
wants
to
steal
your
tools
or
yell
at
you
for
building
guitars
but
also
not
trying
to
get
dragged
into
a
debate
or
anything
i
was
just
trying
to
share
my
appreciation
for
creative
people
and
the
fact
that
i
love
living
in
close
proximity
to
them
cool
story
none
of
what
i
suggested
would
make
it
shitty
for
everyone
thanks
for
your
contribution
why
would
your
somewhat
specific
needs
require
a
new
building
instead
of
repurposing
an
existing
one
it
s
not
that
i
need
a
new
build
immediately
but
a
lot
of
issues
i
am
finding
with
some
of
these
places
is
that
they
do
not
have
grounded
outlets
or
are
using
15
amp
breakers
for
the
service
in
the
garage
does
your
guitar
making
have
to
be
done
in
a
building
on
pristine
land
no
but
a
pristine
workshop
is
the
goal
one
with
real
floors
insulation
and
better
power
distribution
