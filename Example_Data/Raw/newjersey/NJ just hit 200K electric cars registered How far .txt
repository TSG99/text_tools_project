Title: N.J. just hit 200K electric cars registered. How far is state from goals?
-
I expect housing prices to hurt EV sales.  Younger people are more likely to adopt newer technology like EVs.  But if these same people cannot afford a house they are not going to spend their money on an expensive car, especially one that requires you to have a house to install the charger in.
*
I have an EV, but a hybrid or any car that does 35mpg would be better for pricing. At 3 miles per kwh and $0.21/kw electric price my car costs me $0.095/mile (with the $250 registration and driving 10k miles a year). (I actually drive 5k a year so my number is $0.12/mile). The math was `(250/miles_per_year) + (price_kwh / miles_per_kwh)` and I have myself a generous 3 miles per kwh. 

Charging at fast chargers and most level 2 chargers is significantly more expensive than gas. EVs are set up to fail as it stands. I'm a huge fan of them and would buykre but they're prohibitively expensive to buy and the cost to operate them is only masked by your electric bill. 

For the 40-50k that an "affordable" EV costs you can get an Elantra hybrid, a Prius, a Camry hybrid, and much more.
*
I have an EV and I’d say it’s the better option IF access to charging is convenient. There’s nothing better than waking up to a “full tank” every day. 

There’s also the other benefit of being able to smoke any vehicle with a tailpipe too (ridiculous power with some EVs).
*
They'd make more progress if they didn't de-incentivize it with a $250 fee.
*
Removing the sales tax exemption isn’t going to help.
*
EV owners were in shock when they got registration renewal notice this year. 🤣
*
Well we’re going to have a setback for the next four years. 

My wife and I have been all EV since late 2022, never going back to ICE for a daily.
*
we need more public charging places with rate cheaper than supercharger. This will get some of the people who can't charge at home to buy EVs.
*
I’d love an EV but I’m in an apartment and the only charging station near me is a dollar general. Also it seems like everything to do with EVs is extra expensive.
*
I previously had a full EV - had to sell it and switch to a PHEV, but I still love the car!
*
I wonder how many EV's will it take on the roads for there to be a measurable drop in air pollution levels. Anyone have any insight? Has it happened yet?
*
We could have built so much rail with that tax credit...

And just forced people to not buy SUVs and pickups for themselves...
*
very

total non starter unless you own a house and can drop a charging station, esp if you are not in the dense parts of the state where charging stations exist. 

the other things that people dont talk about at all is that our instrastructure in the a lot of the state would have a big problem if everyone added home charging stations.
*
The infrastructure is coming.  Remember, when the car was invented, they didnt have paved roads and they made due.  Demand will create the infrastructure
*
NJ is a smaller dense state, we should be a great state to have charging stations and a lot of EV ownership. Hopefully they can bring down the prices and increase the charging infrastructure more.
*
Charging infrastructure is still ass around me. The newest “luxury” apartment complex only has 4 EV charging ports and the closest public charger in Walmart has lines that remind me of the 1970’s Energy Crisis (okay I’m exaggerating but those lines are awful)

My apartment complex doesn’t have an EV charger so I can’t justify getting an EV at this point even though I’m definitely open to it.
*
Their first goal should be to make the grid handle all the electric cars they want to be on the roads.
*
Electricity prices getting jacked up so high is what will kill them. Gas prices rise but also can fall. Electric is just going to keep increasing more and more. Your local electric provider/the state basically will have a monopoly on what it costs you to drive every single mile. I say this as someone who does like EVs.
*
Pft, I won't even pay the $250 with an incremental increase of 10 bucks per year for 4 years just to own one. It sounds nice in theory until that bill comes.
*
You know what would help them hit the goal? Not charge $250 for each registration.
*
I’ll never get an electric vehicle
*
Love the comments re: hybrids >> EVs.

Yes currently with oil subsidies it's quite cheap.

But if you own a home and get TOU rates, it comes to about $3 to fill up my Taycan 80kw. Gas ain't that cheap and that's sadly why homeowners benefit from the EV tech....
*
Yeah I don't see apartment complexes splurging for charging stations in what little parking they can offer. I think it'd be a perk, but I don't see it scaling without significant state funding
*
Yea, I wish I could get an electric car as someone who commutes to a lobster with plenty of chargers. But I dont have a connection where I rent so its not worth it.       
        
That's anecdotal but I think its a common theme you're describing
*
Thing is EVs are much cheaper compared to regular car. 
For example, Tesla model 3 is about $32k with 0% finance and tax refund benefits. Same price range car like Honda accord and Toyota Camry will have regular maintenance and gas cost. 

This is one of the reasons people are buying it. Whenever the tax incentives will go away, people won’t really buy EV’s because it doesn’t make sense..
*
A Tesla model Y is not expensive these days. Especially with the incentives. But even without those incentives Tesla has lowered the price a lot. It’s no longer a $70k car. It’s not even a $50k car in many cases. It’s more like $40k. And people are shelling out for high priced pickups and SUVs so affordability is not the issue.

I do see charging being an issue, especially since we are building condos and high density housing rather than single family homes. Those are terrible for charging. Public charging is also not ideal for daily driving. Workplace charging can work but more people are wfh now so even that gets problematic. And workplace charging often isn’t implemented properly - it’s free on many places and doesn’t require people to move once their allotted time is up or their car is charged. We need to rethink it. 

But I am hopeful we will solve this, because we really do need EVs to fight climate change. It is a very powerful tool in that fight.
*
I did the math based on the gas tax vs registration fee and I would have to drive my maverick ~25,000 miles per year to break even. I work from home. Hybrid all the way.
*
I grew up in north Jersey, near the GWB and it It was a battle 20 years ago to park daily in front of your own house, I couldn't imagine how it is now, considering my old 2 family home became a 3 family home.

There's many other similarly congested communities in NNJ, and that's not taking into account apartment buildings in these older neighborhoods that relied on street parking.

Charging infrastructure should be top priority when it comes to allocating funds for the EV programs.
*
Not if a full tank only gets you 20 miles.  Or so,
*
This. They paid me $7K to buy the car and didn’t charge me sales tax a few years ago. Now they’re forcing me to pay $250 more for registration - equivalent to the fuel tax a gas car that drives 20K miles in a year would pay. Sure - that’s logical.
*
Yea, they should just do a fee by weight that's irrespective of powertrain trype.
*
That's a fair argument, though the state needs to figure out a replacement for the gas tax. It's better to start now instead of being caught with our pants down in like 5 years when they have to renew the gas tax. I'd rather have them already thinking about it instead of just coming up with ideas when, presumably, EV purchases have snowballed to put a significant hit into gas tax revenue.

TBH, it's all really difficult no matter what they do.
*
BS.  Everyone should pay for road maintenance.
*
Given the implementation, $1,000 fee 😔
*
The setback is due to the the car prices not the president. They need to come for a lot
*
Out of curiousity, why did you switch? Was it a Tesla or another make?
*
Good comparison was [the lockdown during COVID](https://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/data-stories/air-quality-and-covid-part-2/).
*
You think people who are buying an SUV/Pickup for grocery getting are going to stop because we build more rail? Or are you proposing we actually force them to stop?
*
ah yes, for all those times that rail directly takes me to work, the grocery store, to family and friends
*
I did my part by buying a little Prius. It then got rear ended and destroyed by a pickup 😂
*
For sure can't overlook general utility and manufacturing monopolies and how they operate. Shit the fact how an electric vehicle is an extremely old concept yet comes at a premium near luxury is no accident and I think it's a little naive for people to assume things will magically transition seamlessly and logically, especially in the US. People always want their rub. Same can be said for how public transit has been low priority and basically a vague political football to kick around from time to time. 

Sure sake of argument there's always the proverbial technicality example of cheap as chips range anxiety mobile early gen Nissan Leaf as an EV that can be had not for much but it obviously requires a particular life to make sense of it even in a dense place as NJ. 

Obviously people are rooting for them and I'm not a hater, it's just people with means and power love making things inconvenient.
*
Yup exactly. The amount i pay per Kwh is up 50% in 4 years. If I did the math on an electric car back then, it might not make sense today.
*
NJ has a law requiring some EV parking for new developments.

My experience as a site engineer is that developers will almost always install the bare minimum required by the law.

At this point they don’t see it as being profitable for themselves.

Also, we get a lot of pushback from towns with volunteer fire departments who are afraid of electric cars catching on fire and not having the resources to control a fire. Sometimes as a condition of approval, we will be limited to the state minimum amount of EV charging.
*
Many charging station operators do the install for free & or there are great tax advantages for apartment complexes. Im a property manager.
*
There are many tax advantages when setting up EV chargers in apartment complexes or commercial buildings
*
But you still need a place to charge the vehicle regardless of how much it costs to purchase.  That is the biggest limiting factor in all this.
*
> especially since we are building condos and high density housing 

These areas are where NJ should lead the nation in creating prioritized bike and lower-speed infrastructure. Ebikes and e-scooters (and regular bikes/buses/trams/walking) fit in that niche where cars are too space inefficient. Car-sized EVs are fine for sprawly suburbia and denser parts of rural areas, where there is space for garages and offstreet parking. As a bonus, e-bikes/scooters are much more affordable than EV cars, and use batteries more efficiently per pound.

Housing and transportation go hand in hand.

I bought 2 model 3's this year. Both used. The first was a 2023 rwd that cost me $25k and the 2nd is a 2021 awd I bought for $26,900 both had less than 30k miles and a charge cost me $800. It'd actually way cheaper than people think and I've had nothing but pure enjoyment driving both so far. I did trade in the rwd for the awd so I don't currently own both but the point remains.
*
I bought my 2020 Corolla Hybrid for \~22k brand new  (nobody wanted the things) right before the covid car disaster. At almost at 70k miles and still getting 52-55 mpg depending on the tires. Best purchase I ever made especially since I just paid it off.
*
Yeah, for that scenario, people would need convenient access to fast charging. Though, it’d mean spending 15 minutes or so at a charger every so often - not as convenient but doable.
*
lol, an EV, not a golf cart. Most get as much or more than their gas counterparts these days.
*
Wow, when you put it like that that is brutal. I knew NJ was going to find a way to make up for the missing gas taxes but this seems like overkill.
*
An EV will cost the owner way less to own than an ICE car even with the $250 year surcharge. The real savings is in the “fuel” cost especially when charging at home and the overall maintenance costs being drastically lower for EVs.  Gas tax amounts to $.45 a gallon in 2025. If a car or vehicle gets about 25 miles per gallon that’s still $360 a year that owner is paying in gas taxes. The $250 is narrowing the gap, but still in favor of the EV at 20,000 miles a year.
*
Weight + Mileage
*
I think the main problem with the registration pricing is it doesn't just make up for the lost gas taxes, it exceeds them by a lot in the vast majority of cases.  I have no problem paying a "road-maintenance" fee in my registration but I'm not sure how it's fair that it's something like twice the amount that I paid through gasoline taxes with my previous car (which was literally the same car but with a gas engine).
*
Agree, but the new registration cost is beyond what the gas tax is, especially since we bought electric due to not driving much, less than 10,000mpy.  We wouldn't be spending that much in gas tax during a year.
*
Almost like they don't want you to have an EV.
*
Dropping the tax credit is going to hurt sales. That’s been a major boon for EV adoption. 

Tariffs are going to hurt sales because prices are going to go up.
*
I had a 2019 Hyundai Ioniq Electric, which only had a range of about 120 miles.  I started driving more for work, and I just couldn't make do with that small of a range anymore.

So I sold it for a 2020 Hyundai Ioniq Plug-in. I loved everything else about the car so I basically bought the same one.
*
While EV fires are hard to put out, much of this is just unfounded fear of EVs. You have to look at who staffs a lot of these volunteer fire departments - trumpy boomers. People who want noisy loud V8s. EVs threaten that so we have to gin up fear at all costs. EV fires do happen but not as nearly as often as some would want you to believe.
*
The problem is we are building condos in areas like Wayne which is not a walkable/bikeable place
*
Have you driven the new MY?  I dont have a Tesla but a friend is on his new MY and said the improvements to the suspension and build quality are lightyears apart compared to his old one
*
I puzzled over this for a bit. $800 to charge up??  Then I realized that what you meant was $800 for a chargER.
*
Yep. Not only are you paying less per mile but you paid at least half of what an EV costs. And I say this as an EV early adopter/lover
*
I'm hoping by the time it's mass adoption,  charging will be faster. 

Imagine having 250KW charging for the entirety of the charge? I believe solid state is capable but that's still years away.
*
May I speak freely??
*
I’m comparing my car - a Chevy Bolt - to the typical 4 door compact like a Honda Fit or Civic or Toyota Corolla that gets 35mpg or more. They have to go 20K+ miles in a year to pay the assumed cost of my road usage. I only drive 10K a year in this little car so this is a disincentive (my other gas cars more than make up for the fuel taxes - a V10, a v8 and an i4).
*
That part I agree with you.  I wish there’s better way to charge by both weight and mileage.
*
Then we create better infrastructure. It’s a solvable problem with known solutions. There are plenty of similar-density municipalities in other places with far better transportation options.  


I agree that some roads in Wayne aren’t comfortable to bike or walk on. Take Hamburg Turnpike for instance—in some places it’s two narrow lanes in each direction, no shoulder, no sidewalk. In others, there’s a sidewalk, but it’s interrupted by parking lot entrances and a jersey barrier preventing left turn access. People routinely drive 50+ mph on that.


Now imagine an alternate reality where there’s sidewalk + wide bike path, trees, lane, (turning lane), lane, trees, sidewalk. That would take no more space, but be able to accommodate many more travelers. Treat the major roads and intersections like that, add some strategic bike/pedestrian cut-throughs to link disconnected neighborhoods.
Now you’ve got a network which many more people would be more comfortable using, including people of all ages. It *can* be better if we recognize the spatial issue, like you rightfully do.
*
I have not, my only experience with Tesla is the M3 and I'm a total fan boy now.
*
Yes $800 to buy the in home charger and have it installed. I was driving a F150 and spending over $100/week in gas so it pays for itself in 2 months for me at least. But I do a ton of driving.
*
I’d also want to see more reliable chargers and standardization of the handshake implemented everywhere. Having to keep multiple apps for multiple chargers is ridiculous. It should be simple plug n’ charge everywhere
*
It's the internet speak as freely as you want.
*
Bolt owner here in the same boat. It stinks with the added fee.
