Hi! I started a new subreddit dedicated to advocating and promoting micro mobility projects in NJ. We can discuss all things bike, public transit, infrastructure, etc. all geared towards having healthy and productive discussion regarding getting around the garden Staten! Join me over at r/micromobilitynj

Wtf is going on with all these drones? I haven't seen any myself but I'm so confused
*
Will we have legit "bread and milk" days this December?

Anybody know what happened on i-80 west today? This was all I could find online [https://x.com/511nji80/status/1863291469236220327](https://x.com/511nji80/status/1863291469236220327) 

It was basically stand-still traffic for at least an hour, then suddenly it just started flowing again. I saw a few cop cars flying up the shoulder but that was it, whatever happened must've been totally cleared by the time I started moving again

Over the past year, I’ve been sharing videos about everything that makes South Jersey special through my project, [SouthJerseySchnitz](https://www.instagram.com/southjerseyschnitz/). Now, I’m thrilled to launch my first-ever South Jersey merch drop—apparel I personally designed to celebrate our local pride!

These make perfect holiday gifts for Philly sports fans (Go Birds!) or anyone who loves calling South Jersey home. Check it out at [SouthJerseySchnitz.com](http://www.SouthJerseySchnitz.com)—your support means the a lot to me.

Where are the old punks getting a beer in West Windsor?
*
I'm calling on all my fellow citizens to flip off Scott Presler if you see him in our great state
*
I got my flu and Covid shots in October, but I’ve been sick with the flu since Thursday (it struck me literally at Thanksgiving dinner). Is there a new strain or mutation that cropped up?
*
it’s a clear night, go drive to somerset county and see. i can confirm 1 in hillsboro my friend just saw his first one. i’m at dinner up in newark and didn’t see any driving up during the day, but im positive i will have a few waiting for me when i get home in warren. 

i think it’s really important to witness this unprecedented event

Similar to how private companies can operate driverless cars in California. The Navy has drones that are safe and reliable to fly over us in FAA airspace, and so they are beginning to do so.

We’ll see more and more of this in years to come.
*
If you want to get the full drone experience hike your way up to Passaic County and go to a hilly place. I can see the whole town from my place which became a curse when I could monitor the sky for miles. I counted 11 drones in the sky last night. This stuff is out of hand.
*
Maybe for the first potential storm but the storms are going to be very few.
*
Feels like it
*
It was too much trouble for them to issue a statement saying "Yeah sorry guys that's us"? And why test prototype drones over the civilian population?
