Title: We just don't know,' FBI says on the drone sightings in New Jersey
-
they know its just none of our concern
*
‚ÄúWe‚Äôre unsure quite how exactly to lie to you.‚Äù
*
Saw Picatinny ‚Äúconfirmed‚Äù 11 drone sightings while Earle & Dix/Lakehurst essentially said ‚Äúmeh.‚Äù Tells me all I need to know.
*
Shoot one down and see who gets pissed
*
They know. They also know you know. They don‚Äôt know that I know that they know that you know but they will. You know?
*
If **no one** truly knows, we look like a jackass of a country right now.  What would happen if a bad actor were to launch a true aerial assault using devices like these, to release some sort of contaminant into our air or cause some other unknown harm to our populace?  Would we just let them fly around up there indefinitely until we start dropping dead?  Then our government would mull about pointing fingers at each other because too little was done, too late.  If our military doesn't care about them, they're incompetent to a level that I did not think possible, or they already know what they are and what their purpose is and are choosing not to act.
*
Damn, between the nypd wasting thousands of man hours and millions of dollars trying to find an assassin only for them to get shown up by a McDonald‚Äôs worker, and the NJ government saying ‚Äúwe don‚Äôt know lol‚Äù about a stark increase in evening drone activity, the institutions and powers that be have been taking massive Ls lately. No wonder people hate the establishment, they can‚Äôt even do the most basic things.
*
Its just weird because why wouldn't they just say 'we're training new people with Drones' or something? This total non acknowledgement just keeps me at unease.
*
They sent a fighter jet to shoot down a weather balloon, you're telling me they can't shoot down a drone, I call bullshit,  They know , they're not telling us.
*
This community should be able to pull together to solve this Scooby Doo mystery after a lot of hijinks and shennanigans. Also a big ol' hootenanny is due at the end of the mystery resolution where all the characters do a jig together while we all laugh our asses off at ourselves!
*
Folks. I keep saying we should just shoot the drones. The FBI and local officials are telling us they don't know whose they are, that means they are free game. Shoot the fuckers already dammit
*
either they know and they're lying to us which makes me suspicious, or they truly don't know which makes me worried
*
If we turn the windmills on maybe we can blow them away!!
*
I can‚Äôt have this conversation again
*
Feds can find Russian ships near Alaska but this is unknown.
*
So a big portion of this hearing revolved how they want to make sure that something is renewed by congress for them to keep working on drone countermeasures, but this includes things that would allow them to bypass warrants to access electronic devices. I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs a coincidence that these drones started appearing recently when this is all happening - puts it into the public sphere and makes us more receptive for them to get the approval that they need. These drones above us have to be the feds.
*
Then why are we not taking one down?
*
Fly‚Äôem over south Jersey, I‚Äôm sure a licensed civilian would find everyone some answers
*
I think if anyone has a high powered lens that they can mount and add any night filters available for light enhancement and just track the right area could catch anything at night as far as a chassis is concerned. Something that could be looked up, like some new air taxi or really specific drone. I went out with my binocs a few nights ago to have a look at the night sky and there is just traffic all over the place at night with all the different airports around. One thing I saw that was strange 'star' that I swear it had blinking lights like red and green, like a hovering drone maybe doing area surveillance maybe nothing in the shaky view.
*
Lies and the the lying liars who tell them.
*
 Maybe they should investigate
*
yes like those chinses spy drones a few years back that was just people fucking around, these drones are the jewish space lazers mounted on the democrate weather dominator to frame a poor Italian kid for killing a CEO in a false flag operation to make the frogs gay
*

*
Okay so what we know is, they need money. They are drones. They are unmanned. They are man made. They are not shooting them down or using electric impulse technology to subdue them and take them down. This leads me to think they are either Chinese made drones or American made drones. Possibly American because they can test how many people call and in a populated state, they can see how many people per mile notice. Possibly Chinese if they want to put people in a panic before Trump takes office. They are located near Morristown and Bedminster and north Jersey. What strategic items are in North Jersey?¬†
*
Lol yeah sure
*
almost like they want us to focus more on Luigi than these drones.
*
Lie
*
I don't believe it.  Why don't they send out a task force to blow them up out of the sky?  Ok, I know the debris would not be welcome, but, c'mon now.  They know.
*
So no one has attempted to follow any of them to see where they land?
*
They don't know what it is because it's a snipe hunt.
*
The governor of New Jersey should get an attack helicopter from the National Guard and shoot down a drone.
*
I know you know. And I know you know I know you know
*
I have a few thoughts but on a tangent not seen yet maybe: It's Amazon and Walmart conditioning us for their future air drone delivery services. The Boxy Blue Amazon delivery trucks seem to be half the traffic on my road these days. If it all goes airborne then we'll have potentially hundreds of these things flying overhead all day long. Recently one of those Amazon trucks slid off the road and needed to be towed out so I'm not looking forward to some 50 lb drone crashing to the ground or my roof. 

If it was Military wouldn't they be testing out in a desert somewhere or maybe they're at the point the tech needs suburban/urban testing. 

So grab a helicopter with a net and grab one of these things already!
*
They trailed a Coast Guard ship. They're over the ocean at that point and can üíØ be shot down but aren't. Totally not the government lying to us.
*
New jersey is a great place to live
We have drones flying over our heads 
No one knows who and what they are but we are being told not to worry - there is no potential threat 
On the other note for upcoming Santacon you won't be able to bring any liquids to the public transportation!!!
Not even water !! 
So flying saucers - no worries 
Bottle of water - danger to public 

Is this really happening ?
Like are we really that naive ?
*
So no one‚Äôs going to tell us what‚Äôs going on?
*
So, is it the sightings that are concerning or the drones themselves. At this point, I think it‚Äôs the former.
*
When the government is ready to tell us they will. Until then just put your head down and mind your business. It‚Äôs what they expect you to do.
*
I don't give a fuck what some dude from Texas thinks about our drones
*
Shotgun
*
Has anyone managed to throw rocks at any of these or shoot one down? I'm well aware there are probably legal issues with that but at least it'd mean the owner would have to come foward and press charges, which would expose the identity of the individual or individuals involved in this drone mayhem. If this has already happened and no one's come forward, my money is definitely on someone trolling us. Maybe college kids with money, or maybe someone older and weathering who acts like a college kid. Or some sort of crazy viral ad campaign. At least when the monolith thing happened that was fun, but 30 to 50 drones a night is absolutely insane.
*
My boss says he saw one hovering over the power station in Branchburg.
*
How large are these drones? Are they military sized or commercial sized?
*
Drug smugglers dropping off fentanyl
*
Don't Look Up
*
I live in Manhattan and first noticed weird drones in the sky in late October. I was out on my balcony and saw something flying in an unusual pattern - definitely not like any plane or helicopter I‚Äôve seen. At first it kinda freaked me out and I thought we might be under attack. Now I see them pretty frequently.

I assumed they are some kind of drone but why would the government pretend they don‚Äôt know what it is? That makes the whole thing weirder again.
*
Serious question. How difficult would it be for someone to track where they fucking land? They are the size of an SUV and have lights everyone can see. Even with lights off,  residents in NJ surely have drones with night vision that would be up to the task right? 

  
I say this knowing it HAS to be military. But if they play dumb and deny it, what's stopping someone with a drone hobby from investigating?
*
"stupid is as stupid does"
*
Didnt one wreck last night?
*
Just blast them with paintball ü§£
*
Honestly could be China. They're huge on drone swarms.  Or Russia... 

These could just be mapping drones... or they could be dispersing chemical/biological weapons that have a delayed effect ... they could be strapped with explosives eventually... 

Who the hell knows. But by all means let's sit around with our thumb up our ass and say that we have no reason to be concerned about the overhead drone swarms.
*
It‚Äôs probably amazon delivering packages or smth you guys are tripping
*
It‚Äôs just the Giants searching for a quarterback
*
I think they actually do not know.  They do not looking like idiots.
*
It's really funny that the FBI isn't allowed to just come out and say "There aren't any nefarious drones. You're working yourselves up over normal air traffic" so they have to say things like this and the people rile themselves up even more.
*
Its China

Operation bluebeam
*
Bruh it's very obviously aliens. Guys and gals, pack your rifles üó£Ô∏è
*
What do you think of this.. [https://youtu.be/KWF82FblabE?si=fNpMQVDVoeVbpItP](https://youtu.be/KWF82FblabE?si=fNpMQVDVoeVbpItP)
*
Shoot one down and someones gonna find out real quick im sure.
*
I feel like if it wasnt our concern they would be far more assuring of our safety considering the amount of attention its getting at this point.
*
That type of thinking when they're flying these over neighborhoods can fuck completely right the fuck off. How unbelievably condescending and belittling.
*
No, he's probably telling the truth.

The "government" isn't some big entity coordinated by someone who knows everything that's going on.  There's always been a small group of people who know the full story about UFOs, and they lie to everyone else.

**This secrecy is about money** \- the UFO reverse engineering programs with the defense contractors, as alleged repeatedly by the witnesses at the Congressional hearings on November 13 and before that in 2023.  Money is the reason the Senate Majority Leader can't get the UAP Disclosure Act passed after introducing it multiple years in a row.

If Schumer's 64-page act, which uses "non-human intelligence" at least 60 times, was just nonsense, then Mike Turner, who represents the district where the rumors have consistently said the crashed craft were stored, **wouldn't have torpedoed the Act** in the House Intelligence Committee two consecutive times.  And, Donald Trump would have followed through with his promise in 2016 to declassify the UFO files.  It's just common sense that people don't spend political capital to overclassify stuff if there's no "there" there.

So, the FBI is almost certainly telling the truth - they have absolutely no idea what's happening because the people who do know are corrupt politicians who are **panicking right now**.  If the non-human intelligence continues to cause these "drone" sightings where the drones are never found and mysteriously "go dark" or disappear into the ocean, people will actually and finally start to take what all the former government officials have been saying about aliens for 80 years seriously rather than demeaning them or downvoting posts like mine that bring this to people's attention.

The problem is that for these politicians, **acknowledgment means big jail time**, because at the core of the whole situation is that these "unacknowledged SAP" programs do exist, they never were reported to Congress, and now we finally have the reason why the Pentagon has failed its last 7 audits by billions and billions of dollars.  Some of this money was illegally allocated to studying the non-human intelligence, and undoubtedly a lot of it was simply spent by people in the programs on personal expenditures - that's what happens when there's no oversight.

If you are confused by what's going on here, or have just started following this topic, I would encourage those in New Jersey to watch the hearings and do some research into the allegations.  All of the behavior going on right now is exactly **100% consistent** with what we know and has been testified to under oath - from the stolen funds to the characteristics of the "drones" that aren't drones all the way to the expected timetable of 2024-2027.
*
They need a gen z PR person to take over their communications so the lies are covered up with unserious, shitty video edits that do nothing but confuse people further until the general public just gives up
*
It‚Äôs Luigi again
*
I feel like this is the case because the drones are still following rules about having lights on. 

If it really were aliens or another country, wouldn't they do it in a more stealthy way? Either that or they're testing our response and finding out we won't do shit.
*

*
What does this mean?
*
Ok Rumsfeld.
*
I know you know that i‚Äôm not telling the truth üé∂
*
I know that you know that they don't know that you know that they know that I know, but they most definitely will? No, I didn't know that.
*
What are they
*
But did you know that I knew that you know that I knew? 

They are my greatest nemesises...nemisie... what's the plural on that one? 

  
(mystery men, anybody?)
*
Don‚Äôt we have an Air Force anymore?
*
>¬†What would happen if a bad actor were to launch a true aerial assault using devices like these, to release some sort of contaminant into our air or cause some other unknown harm to our populace?


Crop dusting drones are already a thing.
*
The NYPD put in work. The McDonald‚Äôs worker didn‚Äôt just intuit out of thin air that the person in the store was the assassin. The NYPD had to track the guy to the hostel, get the photos, and distribute them to news networks specifically so that somebody would recognize him.

But yeah, somebody should know something about the drones by now.
*
They can do the most basic things. They're just getting worse at lying to you.
*
Well said.
*
They could but it would endanger the lives of innocent people.  They waited until the balloon was over the ocean to shoot it down. Because the drones are at low altitude it would make shooting them down even more dangerous.
*
Probably DHS ordering them to keep things under wraps.   I have not been concerned with these things since about last Friday.
*

*
What is stopping you ? It is your genius idea, why not do it yourself ?
*
Even if it was legal to shoot in the air (it isn't, people die from falling bullets), it is very hard to hit a drone.
*
Yay. So you hit a drone, and your bullet lands in the head of your neighbors kid who has leukemia. Now what? This is exactly why Americans need IQ tests to buy guns!
*
Great idea. Encourage people to shoot at unknown objects flying in the sky that are probably airplanes.

I hope they throw your ass in jail for suggesting it when someone does this and kills a Cessna pilot.
*
Shooting in the air is a bad idea especially around where these are being seen. I‚Äôd rather deal with a drone above than a .01% chance of being convicted of manslaughter from a bullet traveling miles away.
*
What do you think happens when you shoot something?

Does it fall up or down?

Some of you guys show very little sense.
*
You know there's a 3rd option, right?
*
Nobodies got drones. And I don't wanna hear that word in here again
*
Alright but you gotta get over it
*
Ding ding ding

If not the feds, some unaccountable dark contractor like Palentir or Black Cube or whatever they‚Äôre called now.  More surveillance and data mining that nobody but them wants, and it will steadily be normalized
*
They are down here, all over Medford and Tabernacle area the last week. All my neighbors said they would shoot them down but none of them tried when they showed up
*
Half the households in my neck of NWNJ have shotguns. Can't believe it hasn't happened already¬†
*
It's hard, dang near impossible to get a good shot of one. "High powered lens"? What does that even mean? It's incredibly hard to achieve a clear shot with a moving object with bright lights at night. You would need $50k+ equipment, and even then, they wouldn't be very clear.

*
Serious answer is Picstinny Arsenal and Trump Golf course
*
> What strategic items are in North Jersey?¬†

You're kidding right?  Let's start with the Bayway Refinery, processing up to 238,000 barrels of crude oil per day:

then from AI:

Newark Liberty International Airport: As one of the busiest airports in the United States, disrupting operations here could have major implications for air travel and cargo transport.

Water Reservoirs: Several major water reservoirs are located in North Jersey, providing essential water supply to a large population. Compromising these could disrupt water services and public health

Electric Transmission Lines: These lines are crucial for the distribution of electricity across the region. Disruption to these lines could lead to widespread power outages

Rail Stations and Lines: North Jersey is home to several key rail stations and lines, including those operated by NJ Transit, which are vital for commuter transportation and freight movement. Disruption here could impact both local and regional transportation

Major Rail Lines and Terminals: North Jersey is home to several key rail lines and terminals, including those operated by NJ Transit and freight rail companies. Disrupting these could impact both commuter transportation and the movement of goods.
*
If they are truly "suv sized", that debree would be terrible.
*
While yelling Jersey babyyyy
*
Yay, great plan. So now we have bullets/ missiles up in the air over a densely populated area. Genius...

Stupid idea

*
Small SUV
*
I like this idea, but why not use cheap disposable drones? A bus sized drone would have to cost hundreds of thousands.
*
There doesn't seem to be any pilots with good drones in NJ at the moment it seems. Missed opportunity for American drone companies to show off their tech and get footage. 

That said, the rumor is they were coming from the ocean. No one knows where they landed.
*
That's what they want you to think!!!
*
I too do not looking like idiots.
*
> You're working yourselves up over normal air traffic

Have you not watched any of the countless videos? What about that is normal? Why are dozens of mayors screaming for answers? Why are local police departments putting their own resources into investing? You must have some info they don't.
*
The other answers you're getting is why.  People are convinced the drone swarm is real.  If you say it's not, then you're either in denial, or part of a massive coverup and if you're the FBI, they're going to pick coverup.
*
Thanks for the waste of time
*
thats irresponsible to discharge a firearm into the air in NJ.   i do remember seeing drone catching drones that carry big nets, we wouldn't need a big one to snare a couple props and bring one down.  i betcha wed figure it right out.
*
If anyone does shoot one down they should use salt buckshot rounds with a shotgun.

Good scatter and not lethal.
*
I will attempt to shoot one of these drones with an air defense ciws system firing 100 rounds of 20mm explosive cannon shells a second.  I guarantee that that 1 round of the 100 that I fire will hit the drone.  The other 99 will drop back down to earth and preferably hit the house of the karen running the hoa‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..you starting to get the picture of why we cant just ‚Äúshoot it down‚Äù?
*
Just like Bigfoot- no bones from a dead one. No hair. No poop. Absolutely nothing has even been found, yet people are convinced they exist.

If these drones were as common and low-flying as everyone seems to think they are, there would have already been one that was shot down, caught in a tree, or crashed.
*
That something a dumb ass will say
*
Please stop advocating for people to shoot pedestrian firearms up into the air. 

1) there‚Äôs no way in hell you‚Äôll hit it. You ain‚Äôt no sniper ghost. 

2) that bullet gonna come down somewhere 


IMO: anyone talking about shooting drones out of the sky is a direct threat to the life of their neighbors. That thought is so so so dangerously *stupid* that it‚Äôs incredible you haven‚Äôt already died from eating DCON on purpose or something as a prank
*
And there was a recent call for 'limited state of emergency' because of them.
*
my house is directly in the landing path (when it‚Äôs cloudy you hear loud rumbling every few minutes)for ewr in airport if i were to launch a drone its setting off a ground stop at ewr and faa will show up at my house i genuinely believe its classified military testing the truth here does sound condescending
*
Russia already does a pretty good job with this.
*
Skibidi toilet for fbi leader
*
yeah i was gonna say i was about to watch this but got bored because there was no subway surfers gameplay on the side
*
I think the only argument against the stealth approach could come from a foreign bad actor's familiarity with our laws and basically an understanding that these drones, if operated within the guidelines of local and federal laws, can't be shot down, essentially.  I don't know if they're China or my neighbor flying them, nor does anyone here on the ground, and so you can't just go shooting them down, because you run into the issue of infringing upon civil liberties.  I know it's an easy choice for me sitting here in my living room:  Shoot it down, worst-case scenario you end up in district court somewhere and eventually paying out a settlement.
*
Military doesn‚Äôt care. Neither should we.
*
it means if u ever wanted to fly a drone over the arsenal, nows the time
*
You have¬†known drones.¬† You have the unknown drones.
*
There are known knowns, and there are known unknowns,  and there are unknown unknowns. My $ is on Russian drones out of Bedminster, where the late Mrs. T is buried along with, ya know, stuff. Unknown stuff

Coast guard said they don't have authority to deal with it. FBI said they don't know what these are and need people to report any sightings. Congress says the state should address this with their defense systems. State says they have no tech to address it.

I wouldn't be surprised if the air force came out and said they thought someone else was going to deal with it and it wasn't their problem either.
*
The nypd is one of the most well funded police departments in the world. They‚Äôre better funded and equipped than entire militaries. And yet they still couldn‚Äôt bag 1 amateur assassin without looking like incompetent fools in the process. 

The only things they‚Äôre good at are playing candy crush and shooting fare evaders. Not worth the billions of public dollars they receive.
*
Which just goes to show how the government has an unnerving amount of access to everyone, at almost any given time.
*
I OFFER MY HOUSE AS TRIBUTE
*
Go watch the hearing today. Representative Smith talked about how drones have been flying over the ocean, and even believes that may be where they are taking off and landing from every day.

Again more importantly tho it's confirmed these have flown over our coast and the coast guard does not have the jurisdiction to shoot them down. That was Representative Smith's main goal today, to get the Department of Defense to green light local militarys jurisdiction to shoot one down over the ocean and retrieve it.
*
So they should just let these "unknown" aircraft chill up there with no repercussions?  You're telling me they can't follow one into a relatively unpopulated area and take it down there?  Lots of areas where that could be done down here in South Jersey.
*
Can't they just EMP them or net them lol
*
This article says they‚Äôre coming in off the ocean. They can shoot them down over the water. 

https://www.app.com/story/news/local/2024/12/10/50-nj-drones-came-in-from-ocean-12-trailed-coast-guard-ship-congressman-fbi-admits-dont-know-origin/76893631007/
*
Wrong, if you watched the hearing they said there was 30 drones chasing a coastguard vessel... You're telling me they can't shoot them down over water? 


Please.
*
LMAO at this, in other countries the US military has no qualms to blow up whole neighborhoods with hellfire missiles because maybe some terrorist is located there
*
No gun, and one hasn't flown near me :)
*
Shotguns. Shooting birds is like shooting drones, and the shot loses a ton of force/momentum before coming back down. 

Still, it's not a good idea.
*
You don't die from falling bullets. You made that up. Google it. A bullet is too small and too light to kill you from falling. Face the fuckin drone
*
My neighbors kid doesn‚Äôt have leukemia
*
Lol you didn't even spell "kid" correctly and you say Americans need IQ tests...And that scenario you propose is so stupid that I feel bad telling you how stupid it is. How many kids do you think have leukemia in NJ that it's plausible one of them is my immediate neighor, and a my bullet is going to fall on them? By the way, the maximum velocity and weight of a bullet falling from the sky is not enough to seriously harm a human being unless it directly pierced the eye. But imagine the chances of a neighborhood child with leukemia standing outside close to me while I shoot at a drone, and the bullet falls to earth and strikes them lmao. Do you seriously believe yourself?
*
You find out who owns it and who is spying on you. Don't be such a coward
*
They used to know, but they forgot?
*
The other thing with drones is, if you‚Äôre ever chased by one, run downhill. For some reason, they can‚Äôt do that.
*
Is this about the Easter baskets?
*
Like.. that's not really south jersey... like come down an hour or more to the south and you'll get people shooting
*
Shotgun isn't going to do it. You need something high caliber, with good range.
*
Telescopic camera.
*
if only there was a large base in the vicinity housing the exact belligerent institution that invented passive night vision devices in the first place of the kind necessary to figure this out instantly. ü§î
*
I was thinking of some security based ptz camera with really powerful optical zoom with FLIR. Use a vehicle and search around the common areas. The price on this technology is lower than 50k but also can go over that price. Equipment can be rented. Maybe an outline of the shape of the things could be captured even in one or two frames and give a clue about it.
*
We're looking at this all wrong, it's golf courses that are attracting them.  They're just looking to get in a quick nine, and they're just doing deep research on where to do it.
*
I was asking this honestly. While I have lived in NJ for 20 years, I am not as familiar with northern NJ. I don‚Äôt go looking for critical infrastructure. That is outside of my wheelhouse.¬†
*
Also, Picatinny Arsenal is hugely important and a large number of decommissioned missile sites, including one in East Hanover.

Morristown and Bedminster is interesting only because Trump & Associates often fly into Morristown airport and then helo shuttle over to his golf club in Bedminster.

Aside from a large number of Revolutionary War / George Washington stuff and the National Guard Armory (which doesn't hold a lot), I don't think Morristown has much in the way of important stuff.
*
Lol Newark Airport can barely stay running even on a clear sunny day. You definitely don't need a fleet of drones to disrupt flights there.
*
I've never seen one with
*
It‚Äôs a fantastic idea. You could take one down in one shot and we‚Äôd know once and for all.
*
Probably just a horse
*
It baffles me that people are still in denial that this is happening.
*
I have yet to see a video that isn't just lights on a shaky iPhone camera.

The mayors are screaming for answers and the police are putting their own resources into investigating because they're responding to their own constintuents, who are worked up into a frenzy.
*
>thats irresponsible to discharge a firearm into the air in NJ. 

Not just in New Jersey.
*
bird hunters be like ü§î
*
It is irresponsible and eventually someone will do something like this if the government doesn't provide an actual answer. Would you actually be surprised if someone did this?
*
It's irresponsible to shoot down a potential nefarious drone of unknown origin? Sounds more like a civic duty.
*
So can't shoot at it but can drop a net on it to make its rotors clog and drop out of the sky.  Got it.
*
wont do much, drones fly higher than 20 yards
*
I'm less than half serious, but your response is straight up idiotic.
*
Understanding sentence structure and implications are pretty difficult in your neck of the woods ehh?
*
Who's advocating? I said someone would find out the repercussions of shooting one down real quick if it was government property. All that time texting and zero sense.
*
Shits getting actually scary now man....that hearing today was sobering.
*
Pls someone make a Super Graphic Ultra Modern Girl cut so we can be entertained.

Edit: I did it but it‚Äôs trash but it‚Äôs also supposed to be ironically trash, here you go: https://imgur.com/a/sXURDJy
*
This has been my thoughts exactly. It took a Chinese balloon invading our airspace all of two times for them to shoot one down but these drone sightings have been going on for 21 days and they‚Äôve done nothing? I‚Äôm not overly worried.

Guest-posting (not from NJ), but I can think of several major security events in the US that were simply an intelligence failure. Pearl Harbor. There was a time when the FBI didn't take Al-Qaeda seriously.... starting in early 2000.

There was also a time when the previous administration didn't take COVID seriously. 

The fact that leadership doesn't 'care' doesn't fill me with confidence. We can sit here and smugly post all day (and I'm sure this sub is absolutely sick of the drone posts) about how just because nothing's been done yet means everything is peachy, but incursions over US airspace shouldn't be so brushed off. I don't know how you guys are totally cool with unknown UAS just hovering above your homes and no logical explanation. The DoD regularly releases notices (that ironically usually go unnoticed) about UAS systems testing, but there's been none in this case.
*
what about drone unknowns?
*
You guys are hurting my brain.
*
The guy is custody because the NYPD posted images of him. That's called police work.
*
Honestly I'm surprised that someone hasn't taken a shot at one of them yet.
*
He even said the commanding officer at the military base in Lakehurst told him that he doesn‚Äôt have the authority to confront the drones
*
Yes. The US government has laws that protect American citizens more than non-American citizens.
*
> No gun

That's probably for the best.
*
Funnily enough, it has been suggested that skeet shooting be brought back to popularity for this reason. Still a tough shot if not well practiced.
*
You don't find anything.
It crashes on something or someone and the site will be codorned off and you arrested.
*
He was a drone, Gary Cooper?
*
So what? No fuckin ziti?
*
As a piney, I‚Äôll take it¬†
*
Expensive equipment, still incredibly hard to get a good picture with sufficient detail
*
> that invented passive night vision devices in the first place

If you want to go down a weird rabbit hole, look up the history of the US using night vision in combat and what they reported seeing.
*
Okay. Hey, I've lived in South Jersey (exit 3) for about 60 years and it was only when my sons went to Rutgers did I ever go up to North Jersey.
*
> I don‚Äôt go looking for critical infrastructure. That is outside of my wheelhouse.¬†

What does that not even mean. You didn't know NJ had train stations, air ports, reservoirs, refineries? Jesus Christ. It's not anyone "wheelhouse" to notice obvious things.
*
> Morristown and Bedminster is interesting only because Trump & Associates often fly into Morristown airport and then helo shuttle over to his golf club in Bedminster.

You know what, I'm coming around on the whole drone thing now....they may be extremely dangerous, and trump should never come to New Jersey again because of the security risk they pose.  Safety first!
*
Idk. Maybe it was a dinosaur
*
You are too right! I think it‚Äôs safe to say that it is irresponsible to discharge a fire arm into the air in general.
*
Yeah but who gives a fuck about people not in New Jersey. Could you imagine not living here? Absolute batshit people.
*
I'm more surprised it hasn't already happened.
*
Action-hero shit thinking someone can fire into the air and get it with one shot
*
Way too difficult to hit with a rifle. If you look at any Ukraine war footage you'll see the only chance is a shotgun at close range. That isn't even a great way.
*
You think if it was ‚Äòunknown‚Äô to the military they would be doing nothing? ‚Ä¶No. It‚Äôs unknown to YOU, random nobody. By design. Chill.
*
Considering that a huge number of these "sightings" are actually planes, yeah, it's probably a bad idea to shoot at them.
*
Yes because here's the difference.  If you just drop someone's DJI Phantom it's just going to piss them off and little other actual harm is done.  If the thing you *think* is a drone is actually a Gulfstream that's actually 10 miles away and 20,000 feet higher up than you realized, also no harm done because your drone with a towel hanging under it isn't going to get anywhere near it, let alone bring it down.
*
Yes!!! I totally agree. It felt embarrassing too
*
Posting pictures of a culprit is literally the least you could do. Truly not worth the $11 billion per year they receive. They have a literal submarine in their arsenal but they can‚Äôt catch 1 guy.
*
How has not even one amateur drone pilot thought, ‚ÄúYou know what? Fuck it. I‚Äôm gonna send my drone up to see what these things are.‚Äù?
*
Comoletely agreed. In theory it could've happened and we just didn't find out about it, but that's a bit too tin foily for me to be giving serious thought at the moment. Enough of that going around as is lmao
*
Yup exactly, hence why he directly called out the DoD to grant permission for our local (I believe?) Militias to shoot one down. 

Imo the DoD will just keep dodging directly answering any questions until this goes away (or escalates to the poinI'where they cant continue to ignore it). I'm personally convinced they at least have an idea of what these may be, and there is a reason why they aren't informing the public. What that idea and reason might be, well your guess is as good as mine, I really just don't know.
*
Yeah you have drones flying over your neighborhood every night, the FBI, the governor, local officials, all say they don't know who it is which means it's not an American agency, company or civilian, and people like you sit around cowering in your homes and checking the news about what to do and what to think. How about you wake up, have courage, and stand for something. Or shut the fuck up while the strong people do something, and keep your weak ass out of the way. Go play Pok√©mon.
*
People like you are cowards. You stand in line at Target and wait to be told what to do next, never taking life by the balls, never making your our decisions. It's sad. Be a leader. Have courage.
*
No but he killed sixteen Czechoslovakians. The guy was a drone designer.
*
You never had the makings of a varsity drone spotter. Small eyes
*
Well then, wait and watch what happens next.
Whatever it is, doesn't want you to have a clear look at it. I was thinking this is some secret government project but now I think this is not being controlled by the DoD.
*
New Brunswick Rutgers is Central Jersey.
*
Yeah but I got that dog in me
*
I mean, and by no means am I advocating anyone do this, bird shot does exist.
*
That's why you use a shotgun, not a rifle.
*
The guy was caught
*
I watched a local news interview with a guy who said he did just that but his drone was ‚Äúshut down‚Äù when it got close
*
Probably same reason they don't want details of murder crime scenes leaked sometimes or they don't share all the info they have... Best to leave your target in the dark on how close you are on their heels because if they know someone is onto them that gives them a chance to get away
*
Why would I be cowering in my home?  I'm not afraid of airplanes, and every time you strong anti-drone freedom fighters tell me "they're out there, go look" they apparently all mysteriously disappear because all I ever see is normal air traffic, stars, satellites, and the perennial favorite unidentified flying object - the planet Venus.

Calm down and try decaf dork, you're not protecting me from jack shit.
*
You‚Äôre weak. You‚Äôre outta control. And you‚Äôve become an embarrassment to yourself and everybody else.
*
Yeah, cause the government hates you so much. Stop dreading lies and panic
*
In Pennsylvania, by a different task force lol. And they wouldn't have caught him if some random bozo at a McDonalds didn't ID him! That's not police work. That'd be like in a group project 1 guy thinks up the title,  3 other people do all the work, and the first guy gets all the credit.
*
Or to test a widespread, real time surveyor network that costs a fraction of satellites. The amount of denial screams that theyre testing tech that encroaches on the privacy of millions of Americans, and the can't admit that because they would be facing a shitshow of backlash.
*
I have a photography drone lol. You are a sheep.
*
What lies have I said?
It is the best case scenario.

This being some sort of defence project is way better it being something hostile and capable of inflicting damage.

Hobbyist drones have already been ruled out, are you insinuating that these are adversarial drones, isn't that even worse?
*
8 million people live in NYC and millions more move in and out constantly. Finding a single person is a little tricky.
*
A foreign national involvement scenario isnt possible with todays tech. If there was a "SUV sized" drone flying into US airspace form China for example, not only would it not have long enough range, but it would also have been detected by hundreds of radars and defense systems. Ever seen those events where a Russian bomber flew in, and had an f-18 on his ass in less than 10 minutes?
*
Which is why the possibility that this is something sort of covert military project seems rather high.
In any case, these drones are not being hostile, so no point in panicking.

There is an extremely low possibility of this being some sort of NHI activity in which case we don't what we dealing with. However that's maybe like 0.05 percent probability.
*
Have you ever heard of submarines?
