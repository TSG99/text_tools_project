Title: The State Tree of New Jersey.
-
How itâ€™s not the pitch pine is beyond me
*
I have seen Red Oaks in sheltered areas that held their leaves until spring. But it is kind of suprising to see Japanese Maples holding onto there leaves at this time of the year here in Monmouth County.
*
With Bacterial Leaf Scorch ripping through the state, how long will it stay the state tree?
*
Depends on where you live I guess
*
For real, it should have been the pitch pine instead of a common red oak
*
Salem county
*
also as a side note
