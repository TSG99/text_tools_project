Title: 
Rep Jeff Van Drew just said on Fox that Iran launched drones from a "mothership" off the East Coast. Says his sources are "high sources".
-
"High" sources 🌿🍄
*
Maybe the high sources should cut back on their trips to the dispensary.
*
Iran is so overleveraged they couldn't stop the destruction of two of their biggest allies in the middle east, yet they have time to put on a light show in New Jersey? What a clown.
*
fuck that guy. good grief.
*
What happens when you fill the federal government with incompetents, nepo kids and grifters? 

We're all about to find out together.
*
Iran got caught with their pants down when Israel planted explosives in all of Hezbollah's pagers, but sure, they're capable of launching amphibious drones just off of Barnegat Light. Hmm.
*
Lmfao if Iran is the country doing this and we are powerless to stop *Iran* then we are so cooked
*
lol
*
And I bet they were eating the dogs and cats while performing transgender surgeries during recess too
*
And we should trust anything coming from Van Drew or Fox because ... ?
*
Good thing the Iranians put bright flashing lights on their drones so that we wouldn't see them spying us! 🙄
*

*
If only we could infect this mothership with some sort of virus.
*
Iran Is launching drones with colorful sparkly lights on them lol these are people with mini drones made to look big with styrofoam That's why no one's doing anything about it cuz they're perfectly legal.
*
Van Drew. Fox. X. Scroll on, nothing here.
*
If this is true, his dumbass just leaked Top Secret information.
*
High sources aka high up his ass
*
Top 5 moron in congress. Sure buddy.
*
Do we finally have our very own MTG? He’s got the initials thing going already

Yup. Sure.
*
I'm so sure that our military would  act if Iran was at our border launching drones.
*
Keebler elf having too many magic shrooms
*
See, now, if we’d allow those LBI windmills they could’ve stopped them right in the air.

/s
*
Van Drew is a pathetic excuse for life
*
CENSURE VANDREW 

How irresponsible of him to frame his suspicions about Iran as fact, then call for the drones to be shot down. 

Last time a NJ, Republican politician called for civilians to act, we ended up with Jan 6th. 

The House should censure VanDrew for compelling acts of war absent Congress' authorization.
*
His source:

*
source being a crack pipe, yea
*
Is the source Lindsey Graham?
*
Lmao...
*
OK I finally feel totally safe now if this came from Van Drew
*
Every other thing out of fox is a lie, we know this because of the dominion voting lawsuit. I doubt any part of it is true, if it was the cost guard or navy would stop it
*
Most likely his sources are high on something.
*
I'm in Colorado, and about 5 years ago we had drone sightings like you are having. Unfortunately, they went away and we didn't get any answers.
*
If it came from anyone else I might actually believe it
*
mothership like the alien mothership from the independent day move?
*
Good news that there is only one mother ship. Anyone getting Independence Day flashbacks? We just need to send Will Smith and Jeff Goldblum with a virus to infect it to take out the drones.
*
True or not maybe it’ll force someone who does know to fill us in on what the fuck going  on
*
Oh, they're high all right. They were smoking everything but their shoes.
*
Guys maybe this is a good thing. If people keep saying absolutely insane shit, maybe the government will fess up to what the drones actually are.
*
Nothing on fox "entertainment " should be considered a reputable source lol.
*
I mean he's a bigot...so...
*
So, the United States military has *no evidence* of an Iranian "mothership" off the coast? Something large enough to cross the Atlantic. And Iran is using drones with FAA-approved lighting for this sneak attack/surveillance? This is insanity.
*

I’m telling ya !! It’s the truth .. yo pass that !!!
*
Lol no, he did not confirm these drones are coming from an Iranian mothership. What he did say, was that an Iranian drone mothership left its port and the timing coincides with what is seen in NJ. He also stated it could be hobbyists.
*
I'm not saying he's not a moron, because he is, but the silence from the WH is absolutely why the right is able to spin batshit insane stories and people then think Dems are weak.

It's still more plausible than an extraterrestrial invasion.
*
I thought they are all on reddit

*
The coast guard? You mean the same coast guard that was followed by the drones last night?
Dont worry, bidden and heels up harris will fix it. Maybe if the drones were in the shape of a 🍆, she would get right on the case!
*
Did you not watch the video you are commenting on?

> "Iran launched a mothership probably about a month ago that contains these drones. That mothership is off—I'm gonna tell you the deal—that mothership is off the east cost of the United States of America. They've launched drones."
*
Well when you have a  president pulling a weekend at bernies, and a skank for a vp, what could you expect? 😂😂😂
*
Sure did! and I heard him say he thinks thats it. I also read the official announcement that says "Whether this is a foreign adversary or even just a group of drone hobbyists.."
