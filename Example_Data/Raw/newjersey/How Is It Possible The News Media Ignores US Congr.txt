Title: How Is It Possible The News Media Ignores US Congressman's Report of  Off Shore Invasion?
-
It means it’s actually a govt operation and he’s not in the loop
*
I’m more surprised that Smith was actually in NJ at all.
*
Why is it that the commander of the Coast Guard is giving this information to a single congressman and not the president and cabinet?
*
The simple answer as to why nothing is being done is because those in power to do something already know it is our own military doing classified testing. There is a zero percent chance another country has been flying this many drones over NJ for this long and our military will not have responded to capture multiples of the drones. So the fact our military is doing nothing about them means either they aren’t real and people are pointing out regular airplanes and saying they are drones, or they are our drones.
*
Chris Smith, and a sheriff, are the sources. Both are elected officials with no obligation to tell the truth to the public. 

Meanwhile, news orgs need double sourcing on their articles, and evidence. At least the reputable ones. Somebody called that sheriff, and he couldn’t back it up beyond “this is what I’m hearing.” The coast guard patrol boat is conveniently unnamed, so there is no one to call. And the top of the rumor mountain is a bland Congressman of one of our least educated districts trying to grandstand in a party full of mixed nuts.

What’s the factual news here? Congressman demands things?
*
Doesn’t Smith live in Virginia? Surprised he’s aware of the issue.
*
I feel like this is the new crop circle skit.
*
they're coming from an offshore carrier ship.

it's not like they coming out the sea like from underwater
*
People concerned about drones need to study the histories of the Salem Witch Trials and Satanic Panic.

This feels like Jade Helm 15 conspiracies for NJ.  Were you actually paying attention to how many drones were in the sky before everyone started talking about mysterious drones in the sky?  There's a lot of them.  Oh, some were near a bridge, yeah, bridges are nice to take areal photos of.

This doesn't feel like a real thing
*
I'm gonna assume that a random congressperson isn't briefed on military actions. 

There is a near 100% chance these drones have all been US Military, otherwise they would have been dispatched extremely quickly by our military.  And the military might as well just tell everyone in the country to fuck right off because we don't have the right to ask questions about national security.
*
[It hasn't been ignored by the Asbury Park Press.](https://www.app.com/story/news/local/2024/12/10/50-nj-drones-came-in-from-ocean-12-trailed-coast-guard-ship-congressman-fbi-admits-dont-know-origin/76893631007/)
*
Fuck Chris Smith
*
It's above his pay grade.

This is either a psyop or the beginning of a false flag to get us to attack an adversary.
*
How would this be a us miltary operation but the coast guard, who is in charge of protecting our shores and is also a division of the us military, being followed and not in the know? That doesn’t add up
*
Nothing to see here. It's all in your head. Mass hysteria or whathaveyou.... /s
*
Luigi is just the first, more Italians are coming for the weather dominator space laser that makes the frogs gay.
*
WE’RE BEING INVADED!!!!
*
Did anyone else have issues with their Internet?  Many people have said their Internet at some point went out.  Mine did as well.  I didn’t think much of it till I was with other people from around the county and neighboring counties and all of them said their Internet went out. Just thought it was Interesting and curious if it happen to others.
*
Not from the area, and hadn't heard anything about this until just now, I saw it on NBC national news (small story but thats where I first heard about it) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OT9rrkYGAUU
*
It’s The Enclave
*
Seems like everyone has been given marching orders. Governors, Media, Congress persons etc. have been saying the same thing: "There is no threat to the public" with no other explanation. There may be something going on but by who is the question.  Do we believe Van Drew ? The most unbelievable Congress person from the state ? Did he not get the "memo" or is he just that dense? Just waiting for it to suddenly stop with no plausible explanation.
*
Wow this is officially becoming the modern day battle of Los Angeles… 

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battle_of_Los_Angeles
*
The boarder is open to drones as well
*
We are just being conditioned to ignore them so when the actual drone invasion happens we will get full Mitchell versus The Machines but with no Mitchells...
*
surprising but wait to see more in coming months
*
One of the NHI motherships is down in the ocean near NJ, so that is where it manufactures and recalls its drones. 

Maybe the phenomenon will go away on its own. But this time it feels different. I think this is acclimization  until the mothership armada arrives .
*
Media is controlled by the CIA. That's the truth of the matter. They don't want this getting too much attention. Local news has been okay with it.
*
Hopefully, it's our government. However, our current administration is asleep at the wheel. So who the fuck knows what's going on up there.
*
Ummmm….its just kids w toys
*
Bingo. I've personally concluded, based on picking up bits here and there, that the Navy is conducting tests on secret experimental drones. The MIC is siloed and is not about to go telling everyone about what they are doing. The media is loving the clicks, so everything is "WhAt'S GoInG oN In nEw JeRsEy?" Fucking dumb.
*
I don’t understand how the same people who think *they* are putting chemicals in the water to turn the frogs gay, who think *they* are injecting use with microchips, who think *they* are controlling the path of a hurricane, are suddenly now take this at face value wondering if the state of NJ is a safe place to live. Take a deep breath, my dudes. 

It’s our own military testing something out, albeit in a sloppy way (in my opinion, as I sit here sipping my coffee).
*
There’s no reason to keep Congressmen in the loop on this. Odds are it’s R&D from the military.
*
>It means it’s actually a govt operation and he’s not in the loop

How does that explain the private news media not reporting on a sensational story line? That's their business model. It's how they make money. Here's a Congressman reporting during a Congressional Hearing that the Sheriff has a unit of detectives who detected a fleet of 50 drones coming off the ocean into NJ. And the media stays quiet? wtf is THAT all about?
*
He's not.. he's in his mansion in Virginia.
*
I had the same reaction seeing him at Middletown Day this year.
*
We'll start hearing press releases from his team soon regarding labor conditions in China or some other nonsense he has absolutely no control over, and thus isn't responsible for. 

But it makes his voters feel good.
*
Because /r/newjersey is the new home of /r/conspiracy
*
note that the drone bro OP has provided no link to any source at all and we are "taking his word" here.
*
Congress approves military action more so than the president.
*
It’s also worth noting that this is all happening near Trump’s golf course. Secret Service is probably there as we speak prepping the property before Trump goes into office next month. If they thought there was a danger, I feel like they’d be getting involved.
*
Not necessarily. Remember the unidentified weather balloons that were flying above the heartland a few years ago? That turned out to be China. Maybe this is something similar to test our defenses.
*
Classified testing in full view of the public? US government has tons of land with no people living in it if they wanted to test their shinny new toys.
*
Chris smith who didn’t see a thing because he doesn’t live here lol
*
>Meanwhile, news orgs need double sourcing on their articles, and evidence.

The story is that a US Congressman made these statements in a public hearing. On video. On Live CSpan. They don't need double and triple sources to report what a US Congressman said in a Public Hearing.

So, why are they silent? It is their business model to run with headline grabbing stories. Why are they acting differently now?
*
Watch the hearing, it’s on CSPAN.  This wasn’t him tweeting some conspiracy theory, this was on the floor of Congress, other representatives had similar questions and concerns.
*
I read his wikipedia and it looks like he is very trumpy. however I was surprised to see he is against concealed carry so he is not 100% a dancing clown buffoon like most right wing politicians.
*
And what a coincidence, Lakehurst Navy Air Base is in Ocean County, NJ.
*
> People concerned about drones need to study the histories of the Salem Witch Trials and Satanic Panic.

We - as a country, and as a people - learned nothing from the Satanic Panic. In fact it never really ended, just laid dormant for a little while. And now it's woken up from its nap refreshed and re-energized, with right-wing lunatics accusing people they don't like of literally being demons and opening demonic portals, as if those are real things.
*
The Governor says its real. He says he was told by Homeland Security that the drones are real. And that they "go dark" when Homeland Security attempts to track them with Homeland Security or military equipment.  I an 72 years old. Lived in NJ all my life. I have zero reason to disbelieve the governor of my state when he tells me this shit is real and that he is taking this "deadly seriously".
*
The thrust of my post is why isn't this THE entire news story of the day this morning? Top Mast of every newspaper in the country and the only story on the major networks?
*
This is back in 2019... 

https://www.twz.com/drone-swarms-that-harassed-navy-ships-demystified-in-new-documents

This has been going on for a bit.
*
Perfectly good question that they refuse to answer.  Rep Smith also spoke to the commander of McGuire Air Force Base who told him they have the capability of bringing down the drones, but aren’t “authorized” to do so.
*
to be fair, the coast guard is Homeland Security and the "military" (army, navy, air force) is DOD.

govt is a big place, and friendly fire, due to lack of communication, resulting in loss of life is not uncommon, unfortunately, so a drone exercise not being disclosed to a random coast guard ship is not unlikely, especially if there is any classification tied to the exercise.
*
Interesting video. Thanks for posting.
*
Fuck don't start with NJ please
*
This is why I keep listening to Guerilla Radio.
*
Do you think that Congressman Smith is at all worried that the U.S. is about to have a Putin asset installed in the White House?
*
Agree. But I wonder if when the testing/exercises are completed - will they let the public know that’s what it was? It would suck if the drones vanished and there was no official explanation…
*
Its either China or US and im heavily leaning us at this point. 

When you dive down the rabbit hole of US drone tech development, law, recent incursions dating to 2019, red teams, war games etc this 100% makes sense. Theres so much valuable development information to do an operation like this which requires basically everybody besides those at the tippy top to know and that includes keeping the FBI in the dark. 

Public reaction is also key to this...trains the public to look at the sky more and act as a first defense system against a potential enemy. On top of local police reaction, local leaders, and the fed ability to deal with drones from a criminal element. 

Like 90% this is us, 10% its china which means wow....our military really does suck lol.
*
I had that hought in my head this morning.. what if they are testing single and dual man military drones that drop off small units .. that’s the only explanation that even remotely seems plausible at this point
*
But why in such populated areas? Why not test these away from the public?
*
How do you know they aren’t searching for something?
*
Has there ever been a situation where Navy or Army would test new experimental secret hardware all over small towns, critical infrastructure. Why would they do this?
*
They're trying to get public approval of a higher budget. It's all a bunch of BS
*
what does "MIC is siloed" mean?  i never heard those terms or that expression
*
Absolute horseshit. Do you know how many people would be involved in those tests? Do you know how many people would be required to construct, manufacture, transport and test these drones, let alone operate the Navy ships required for ocean-based testing?

Your explanation is a conspiracy theory that doesn't make sense. WAY too many people would be involved. There would be leaks. There would be people talking.
*
Drone stuff is probably about Trump's place in Bedminster or immigrants.
*
Also, I might be naive but I am pretty confident that the first military super power in the world has a good handle on its airspace. Zero chance of an “undetected invasion”.
*
Is it sloppy, or is the test to see exactly how local govt and populace react to these situations?
*
I mean… when we had an earthquake they reported it was “west of NYC and east of Philly” 

Suffice to say, I’m not shocked.
*
Let's just call it "Weird New Jersey"
*
I assumed everyone here knew about yesterday. Guess not. Have at it bro.

[https://www.reddit.com/r/NJDrones/comments/1hbejxo/rep\_smith\_statement\_to\_drone\_committee\_50\_drones/](https://www.reddit.com/r/NJDrones/comments/1hbejxo/rep_smith_statement_to_drone_committee_50_drones/)
*
Yea but this should still be presented to the secretary of defense and armed services committee.
*
And it was shot down like 6 days later. This has been going on for 2 weeks.
*
And that entire incident was over in less than a week.  It only took them so long to shoot it down because they weren't going to do it over the mainland and waited until it went over water.

This drone thing in NJ has been going on longer and they haven't identified anything - which means exactly what everyone else is saying. It's ours.
*
Over North Jersey? I mean, we think we are the center of the world sure but we are not that important. 

  
Its a US Military operation. Its as simple as that.
*
You mean the one that was flying around during trumps previous run?
*
Yes a balloon most likely not meant for the US cause the last thing you want is for your enemy to get your recon equipment since it’s a fucking slow ass balloon.
*
That just suggests there’s a reason it needs to be done in NJ vs. something like area 51.
*
If what they are testing is the ability to scan heavily populated areas, then yeah, it makes sense to do it in NJ. You know the kind of testing they would want to do if they think they may be heading into a possible fight over cities or densely populated areas. Like if for instance if China decides to invade Taiwan while we are all busy fighting amongst each other over the Trump administration.

Also they may simply not care if the public sees anything and it is more convenient to keep the testing near where the work is being done, like for instance the Picatinny Arsenal which is one of their weapons testing facilities. Just because they don’t care if the public sees something doesn’t mean they are going to openly explain what they are doing, or even admit they are doing anything at all.
*
Because “backbencher congressman makes demands that will be ignored” is a story they could write a hundred times a day. It’s a show, a performance, until he drafts up a bill to secure funding. *Which he is not doing*.
*
Lots of congress people say lots of things "on Live CSpan" that could be bigger news stories but aren't. Unless their particular batch of nonsense lines up with somebody with a platform's agenda, a congressman saying he heard a thing from a guy isn't inherently page 1 news.
*
>  I was surprised to see he is against concealed carry so he is not 100% a dancing clown buffoon like most right wing politicians.

Why would anyone be against CCW? Doesn't make any sense if you actually know the stats.
*
and the only company with an FAA permit for autonomous drones is based in Philly and their ship is usually docked there, but now it's offshore somewhere launching the drones
*
Because the drones are our own.
*
It isn't bigger news since there is NO VIDEO. There are no videos of drones that depict anything unusual or anything bigger than a store bought drone. There ARE NO videos you can prove were shot recently in New Jersey of "large numbers" of drones. All we EVER see is just shots with AT MOST two- count them TWO- drones in them.
*
Because the military knows what it is ....
*
What is your best guess? What do you believe is the most straight forward answer?
*
there won’t be, look up colorado drone swarm
*
At this point maybe sooner than later if we do....

Would be kinda hard to just be like "Thank you all for coming today to this press briefing on the drone invasion and what I can report, the drones are gone. Thank you for coming."
*
Don’t hold your breath. It’ll come out in 30 years after declassification and FOIA request.
*
A simple statement saying this is a test by a US government department of technology just to shut up all the noise.  Instead, they play stupid, and it only makes the noise louder
*
Maybe these drones are designed to collect data or perform observations over populated areas. It's kind of difficult to create a test on such a scale. NJ has offshore ships and tons of military bases. Maybe they flew over Picatinny in collaboration.

I just believe that to think it's not military is just drifting into conspiracy. Sort of like how Area 51 is filled with aliens...which may be true, but in reality, it's just experimental technology being tested.

Edit: To add, we don't know if there are feet on the ground attributing to the testing. Maybe it's field comms where soldiers can be directed or speak across secure lines.
*
Because they probably already completed those tests.
*
Operation Sea-Spray is just one instance that comes immediately to my mind. So yeah, 110%.  
Edit: The difference is, in Sea-Spray they unleashed biological contaminants on San Francisco.  
People... this is really not as far-fetched as you think.
*
[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical\_human\_experimentation\_in\_the\_United\_States](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unethical_human_experimentation_in_the_United_States)
*
I'm guessing it means that knowledge of the secret operation is restricted (siloed) to the man in charge (MIC) of the operation.
*
How many people? Let's hear what you have to say. It's almost as if you have no idea about the MIC, but I'm willing to listen.
*
Lol... if you think *that's* horseshit, I can only imagine the alternative theory you'd be willing to offer.
*
They are being spotted all over the place and not just focused there.
*
Why Trump's place in NJ now though?  Trump will be in the White House for the nxt 4 years.  You'd think the drones would be in DC.
*
It wasn't that long ago that the military was scrambling fighter jets and shooting down weather balloons meandering over our airspace. Zero chance that they're allowing unknown swarms of drones to just do their own thing.
*
If they're flying around Trump's golf courses, it's likely a test of whatever drone detection system is being installed to protect the President in the event that someone does try to fly a drone over and pop him while he's playing golf on one of his 200+ golf days a year. 

It would be somewhat unfortunate if we didn't have a way to know that a drone army is showing up near the most densely populated area in the country in any capacity as well so it wouldn't shock me if there's something being installed on the coast lately that they need to test and you don't really just put it in and hope for the best when people's lives are at stake, but you also probably don't want it being front page news that now there's a system that detects drones so get to work cracking that tech.  

Probably similar to missile defense systems where nobody's REALLY sure what kind of capability we have to knock a nuke out of the sky before it leaves Russian/Chinese/Korean space.
*
That’s a good point! I was thinking earlier that this could be a test on how willing *civilians* are to call in things to the FBI, so similar vein.
*
You assumed everyone knew but the whole point of this post is “why didn’t anybody know?!” I’m as confused as the people gazing up at the drones.
*
sorry skippy nobody is going to watch two hours of video looking for the moment in it that you have chosen to misrepresent. Can you give me the time stamp where we hear the testimony you claim?
*
They are usually briefed. 

That hearing yesterday was very interesting and eye opening....theres a giant beurocratic chain of command when it comes to the military reacting to an immediate threat on the homeland.
*
This has been going on here in NJ since November. It’s just seems to catch on and ramp up the last few weeks
*
We have several based including specifically the arsenal that does research
*
The Chinese spy balloon? That was 2023, so Biden was in office. 

Almost 2 years ago?! Time is doing something weird. I’m old. Ugh.
*
do you have a source for this? my parents are losing their minds over these drones and i want to tell them about this so they'll stfu
*
My question isn't why the media isn't reporting about the drones. My question is why the media isn't reporting that a US Congressman claims the Ocean County Sheriff has equipment that detected 50 drones flying into NJ from offshore; and also claims the US Coast Guard told Smith that their NJ Coast Guard patrol was followed by 12-30 drones.

A US Congressman making those claims in a public Congressional Hearing is a huge story. But one the media -- prone to sensationalism - is ignoring.
*
Presumably the news media is interested in making money. They chase the most sensational stories of the day by creating huge headlines. What could be more sensational than a sitting US Congressman reporting that the Ocean County Sheriff's Department has recorded evidence of a fleet of 50 drones flying into NJ from the Atlantic Ocean?

I suspect you want me to believe that ever newspaper in the world is obeying orders of the CIA. But that is way too much of a conspiracy for me to believe. Is that what YOU believe? That every major newspaper is being silent out of fear of the CIA?
*
I lived in Colorado when this was happening and was shocked that there was no follow up. Then again, with all the defense contractors out there plus the various military installations that regularly flew military aircrafts (Buckley, Air Force Academy), and the rural locations, we all just kind of chalked it up to something "secret." 

The NJ stuff is way crazier because it's such a heavily populated area. As someone who grew up in North Jersey during/after 9/11, I refuse to believe that the American military would allow unknown aircraft/drones to fly anywhere near NYC so casually.
*
"Military Industrial Complex"
*
He won't be in DC much lol.
*
more open space, less prying eyes.  Lamington is a bit spread out, and on the boarder of Hunterdon.
*
Hey Mr Peanut for brains ... there is a link to the video clip of just Smith talking in the comments. If you weren't an asshole, I'd put it here. But go find it yourself.
*
1:26:00
*
You can easily put the link into ChatGPT and have it do that for you and find supporting sources. 

>During a recent town hall on Long Beach Island, Rep. Chris Smith (R-NJ) discussed a troubling incident reported by a U.S. Coast Guard commander from Ocean County. A 47-foot Motor Life Boat from USCG Station Barnegat Light was closely pursued by over a dozen drones during a patrol. Additionally, an Ocean County Sheriff's Department officer observed more than 50 drones approaching the beach from the ocean.

>Rep. Smith expressed concerns about the potential involvement of foreign entities, such as Russia or China, in these provocative drone activities. He has urged Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin to deploy resources from Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst to investigate these incidents and, if necessary, neutralize the drones. Smith emphasized the importance of addressing these security threats promptly to alleviate public concern.

I'm right in the middle of it in central NJ and I went and looked on our town's FB group yesterday and the first mention of mysterious drones was on November 27th. That was 2 weeks ago today. Can you find an earlier confirmed date than that?

Edit: I stand corrected. I found a Reddit posts about drone sighting in NJ and Bucks County PA going back to the first week of November. It's been going on longer than I thought!
*
I started seeing them around the Northern Lights Display (because that's when I started going out and REALLY looking at the sky for extended periods of time) and that was on October 10th. It has ramped up though in activity the past 2-3 weeks.
*
So exactly the kind of bases that would be conducting military drone testing?
*
no i aint got no source.  tell them to calm down, ask them if the military ever admitted to the existence of stealth fighters and new planes during testing periods.

this company uses VTOL style wings, so it looks like a predator drone in flight (why they're all being mistaken for planes), but can swivel their wings and hover.

the fact they're flying over critical infrastructure and military locations is all u need to know.

the people crying about China and Russia is hilarious.  do they really think we'd allow drones to come and map all our sensitive soft targets every night for weeks?

nevermind the fact that they wouldn't be able to control drones over our soil like that anyways
*
Are you new to "paying attention to the news" skippy? In the last month the governments of Germany and France BOTH FELL and it has received less press than your dumb drone issue. BELIEVE ME the drones are getting way more than their fair share of coverage.
*
gosh, it's almost like your absurd bias against the sensationalist media is being proven wrong.  

And maybe, just maybe, some of the things you think have been sensationalist over the decades have just been regular factual news you didn't want to accept.
*
Or maybe because it is the 2nd or 3rd hand word of a kooky member of Congress and not the actual authorities that are relaying it? Has the Ocean County Sheriff's office confirmed the report themselves?
*
I actually don’t believe the CIA has anything to do with it. I just believe there is a ton of fear mongering and the want to be relevant by politicians seems the most logical. I actually believe that if there was a drone invasion it would be leaked in a heartbeat and on the NYT
*
yup, the only way this is allowed is if they are in control of the situation. there is no shot these things even make it here in the first place. if they’re coming from the ocean, then we are testing naval deployment of them
*
You bust Class B airspace in NJ while flying a small plane, and the gates of hell would open up on you.
*
Yeah that makes more sense
*
Fair, but he's generally at Maralago all winter and only in NJ during the summer.  Just seems odd for these to be largely based in morris county.
*
so you have nothing, got it. this is what happens every time you ask to see video from the drone bros. The politician in question offers zero proof of anything in his statements, and just says he "heard from a guy" that "they saw something". If there were crew on a Coast Guard vessel "followed by fifty drones", there 100% would be video of this and there IS NONE. HERE is some video from the Ocean County Sharifs department and what do we ACTUALLY see? A single drone with no establishing background features to give it any context at all then it cuts to a shot of some DIMWIT cops speculating- the two dimwit cops are the stand-in for ALL the drone bros like they are your spirit animal.

*
A guy I have been watching on YouTube, Thomas Fessler, has been going live mostly every night the last week and he has been saying that he(and his team, he has guests on) have been “on this” for a month. The Guardian said “early November” - at the end of the day — who knows? I think they’ve probably been around but more people are just looking up now.
*
Was it not late October that Picattinny had drones over it?
*
Military bases, that NJ has a lot of?

Edit:
I misread the comment and thought they were asking what kind of bases. Oopsie
*
You don’t need an airstrip sir
*
rotfl that’s what i told them- these things would have been shot out of the air if the government didn’t want them there. their response was “well not with this administration” so they’re too far gone at this point. oh well. 
*
So you just making shit up without a source ? 🤣
*
My question is why is the media ignoring the story? Since when does the private media - who is interested in making money by attracting viewers to sensational stories - not reporting on a US Congressman saying 50 drones flew in from off shore? The non-action of the media is what is so puzzling and interesting - and is the thrust of my post. Any thoughts on how a media that has ALWAYS been interested in sensationalism, has suddenly gone quiet?
*
But my question is why is the private media ignoring one of the most sensational headline grabbing stories possible? They NEVER ignore sensational stories. Why this time? That was my post. You asked me what I believe to be the most forward answer - implying that there was one and that I should know it. So, I'm asking you - why is the private media suddenly not reporting on a sensational story that history shows they always jump all over?
*
Why are they testing these secret things so close to the most densely populated area of the country? And what's so secret about a group of drones, anyway?
*
yeah OK tell them to go fly a drone by an airport or NFL stadium and see what happens to it.

also ask them about the fact that they have, oh i dont know, LITERALLY FAA compliant lighting on them??

didnt realize UFOs or stealth attack drones would have red/green wingtip lights and white strobes on them.

but no, it must be Sleepy Joe's fault....their TDS is real and im sorry :-(
*
Because Smith is saying that someone (the O.C. Sheriff) told him that someone (unidentified rando) told him they saw it. As far as I know, the Sheriff hasn't gone on record to confirm Smith's statement. 

The media isn't ignoring the story (as noted the local paper covered it) but without anyone willing to go on the record, there isn't anything more to report.
*
It is not a story is the most likely answer
*
You have been given the answer over and over and are ignoring the answer because the answer doesn't fit under your tinfoil hat.

maybe they are testing equipment they want to use in densely populated areas of foreign territories? i mean - there's lots of reasons the Military would do things and not tell every single American citizen. The reality is - what we do know, is already 5-10 years old anyways. So if this is the U.S. - these arent new technology that we're being exposed to.

I’m sure the military or MIC has all sorts of rationale for doing what they do. They don’t contemplate or perceive things the way ordinary people do… It’s also possible that gauging public reaction is part of the testing.

Maybe the goal is to see how drones do in a heavily populated area? Want to make sure the signals to and from the drones can handle heavy amount of interference in the air.

They're probably based out of JBMDL.

the setting is an integral part of the test.

frankly a bigger news item would be a headline like this: "Ocean County Sherif Department Devotes Resources to Investigate Conspiracy Theory - Presents Zero Evidence For Outlandish Claims" and the story would ask why Sherifs officers were "investigating" something yet brought no equipment to record anything. Not even a smart phone?
*
Just like Hunter's laptop being "obviously fake"
*
which is why we should be outraged, don’t let them turn us into a country with omnipresent drone surveillance. we got to play the beta, shit on it relentlessly so that we dont let this reach full release.
