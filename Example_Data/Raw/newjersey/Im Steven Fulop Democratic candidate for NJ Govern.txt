What are your thoughts on making public transit usable to get around the state vs just going to NYC or Philly?

If I want to get down the shore from most places I can either drive or have to take a train to Secaucus and go back down.

We've got driving infrastructure, how can we have public transit that actually lets people get around the states?
*
NJ is the densest state in the nation, and yet most of the state requires a car to access. What will you do as governor to improve alternative modes of transport, like public transit, bike & pedestrian infrastructure within the state (not just for commuting to NYC & Philly) to reduce the gridlock on our roads?
*
If you become governor, is single payer state health insurance something you would look into implementing?
*
Any thoughts on merging municipalities services to keep costs down like north Hudson fire department has done?
*
What is your elevator pitch of "things you know you'd be able to fix it you are elected"?
*
What do you consider the Murphy administration's best policy achievement?

On what policy would you say the administration fell disappointingly short?
*
Do you believe the state’s stringent allotment of liquor licenses is really beneficial to local businesses and/or residents? How are new restaurants expected to thrive if they don’t have the capital (or let’s be honest here, connections) to obtain a liquor license? Better yet, why are there breweries and distilleries in the state that are allowed to serve people liquor but not food? Do you think this is a problem given how many people then get in their cars and drive home?
*
What exactly is your plan for the housing crisis, in NJ, new condos and apartments are not fixing the lack of first time homes while corporations/investors ae not only outbidding but entirely breaking the pricing. Structure. As of now, a 4 bedroom 2.5 family home middlesex county and neon is averaging 650-700k.

It seems impossible right now for anyone without equity pre 2020 to even get their feet wet.
*
I just wanna take the NJ TRANSIT to work without gambling on whether it'll work or not.

It's a bare minimum. I just wanna go to work. ![gif](emote|free_emotes_pack|sob)

As governor, what specific things do you plan on doing to fix the constant issues with the train for thousands of commuters?
*
What politicians or states do you look to for inspiration or as an example of who you would want to govern like?
*
What is your proudest accomplishment as mayor of Jersey City? What is your biggest regret?
*
What is your plan to address the cost of living crisis in New Jersey? I'm 24 years old and I'm not sure if I'll ever be able to afford my own apartment, let alone buy a house in New Jersey. This is probably the biggest issue Democrats are facing nationwide and they've shown little interest in doing anything to stop it.
*
I read a brief synopsis on your feeling NJ has too much government ( this was in reference to property taxes.  Your response was that Trenton needs to reform our layers of government…to paraphrase).  Can you elaborate and how the heck would you move it through the entrenched interests. (BTW, I agree..  I think county governments in particular are bloated and often redundant)
*
New Jersey has 565 municipalities, many of which are small and have duplicative services, contributing to high property taxes and inefficiencies. Would you support efforts to mandate municipal consolidation to reduce redundancy and lower costs for taxpayers?

Edit: While the governor may not have the authority to directly consolidate municipalities, you could influence the legislature and use tools like conditional funding or state aid to encourage consolidation. Would you be willing to use your executive power to push for policies that reduce the number of municipalities and address the inefficiencies driving up property taxes?
*
How will you help support teachers and education in the state?
*
How are you going to get more housing built? Of all types (Single family, multi-family, mixed use, etc)?

Housing and renting costs are completely out of control and there's not enough supply to handle demand! New housing is generally focused on single family and luxury apartments, even these are not being built fast enough.

Because every municipality has power to set its zoning, what will you do to "encourage" municipalities to build/renovate more?
*
Do you plan on upholding the hiring/promotion freeze for state employees introduced by Murphy? 

What do you think of the fact that our state pays employees less than the amount required to actually live in this state, with so many state jobs paying in the range of 45k-50k? Do you have any plans to fix that?
*
How can we help Camden and Trenton have the same economic success that Jersey City is having?
*
Not sure if this comes under government but there is a medical crisis in NJ, it is ridiculously hard to find a doctor as a new patient. Even finding a primary care doctor is not easy. Emergency care is broken as well since covid. Is there a way we can add more doctors and healthcare professionals so that we can reduce the wait time?
*
What’s the deal with the drones?
*
If you are not the Democratic nominee, how will you be supporting the nominee to ensure we keep a Democrat in the Governor's seat?  Will you still be working for the candidates running down your slate if they get nominated and you do not?
*
If you’re actually against political bosses and the machine, can you explain why it was acceptable for you to support one of the biggest political bosses in the state (Brian Stack) as the Hudson County Executive? And why was it okay for you to place Amy DeGise, the head of the Hudson County Democratic Organization, on your ticket last election?  You seem to love attacking every other candidate for benefiting from the system, but as a resident of Jersey City (who has voted for you all three times you ran) I’ve seen you do it many times too.
*
Wage disparity is arguably the number one issue facing America right now.  The rich just get richer and everyone else is basically standing still by comparison.  With NYC and Wall Street being a big part of why this is happening.

What realistic things can/will you try to implement to help us normies or should we expect more or the status quo from you?  Aka doing absolutely nothing.
*
Hello mayor!

Living in Jersey City really showed me how awful public transit is in NJ. With that being said how do you plan on fixing NJ Transit and modernizing it as well as working the Port Authority to improve PATH service as it has degraded year over year with no signs of improvement.
*
How can reckless development be addressed on a state level? From going to local municipal meetings, it seems as long as developers meet whatever standards exist that little can be done to stop them from slapping down more concrete monstrosities (such as last-mile warehouses) in residential neighborhoods. Is it possible that a state level legislation could be put forth to allow the will of residents to prevail over these developers?
*
In three sentences, please tell us how you plan to support New Jersey's libraries and librarians.
*
Should we have a statewide law to eliminate minimum parking requirements, like Minnesota recently passed?
*
Do you feel the use of super PACs by candidates to be a morally objectionable path to take in regard to campaign financing? Why or why not?
*
One more... what are your thoughts on requiring places of worship to contribute to property taxes, eliminating PILOT programs for developers to ease the burden on property taxes for residents?
*
Your policy doc discusses child care assistance, this is a hot topic. Curious what your take on preschool is, I imagine your policy is only looking to subsidize daycare costs. Do you support or have a plan to implement universal free preschool in the state of NJ. If so will this be capped at 150K? Any opinion on increasing the cap, 150k is quite low NJ considering the high cost of living here.
*
New Jersey's farmland preservation program has been a crucial tool in maintaining our state's agricultural heritage. How do you plan to continue supporting this initiative, and do you have any plans to expand the conservation of open space across the state?
*
Under your stewardship, Jersey City rents have exploded, displacing longterm residents and making this town unaffordable for all but the wealthiest newcomers. 


Furthermore, almost everything being built is a LUXURY rental and houses that were owned and previously could be purchased (and fixed up by average people) are being knocked down to build very expensive condos and LUXURY highrises. 


Why have you allowed this to happen in Jersey City and do you have a plan to make home ownership in NJ affordable for people earning minimum wage? Because we can all agree that people earning minimum wage deserve to live in NJ too, right? 
*
How can NJ best prepare for mass automation in the private sector over the next governor’s terms?
*
What are your thoughts on towns that enjoy higher property value due to a local train, but at the same time ban adjacent out of towners from parking their cars to take said train, essentially creating a private train for a small subset of NJers. 


Do you believe towns should be forced to host a park&ride or risk their local private station being shut down?
*
What will you do about improving our broadband infrastructure?
*
Have you seen public schools closing in texas. Are ypu worried that could happen here if tax funds keep being moved toward school choice. 
What actions would you take to combat choices made at a federal level to diminish our civil rights.
*
What are your plans on our state's future energy goals? How do you plan to expand green energy including nuclear energy?
*
Hey Mayor Fulop, thanks for throwing your hat in the ring and I appreciate your acknowledgement that new housing construction is one of many tools we need to use to keep NJ affordable. 

I'm wondering what your thoughts are on reforms to New Jersey's reliance on property taxation to fund localities. I know you've got a payroll tax in Jersey City that's had some success, what other funding sources would you be open to allowing localities and counties to tap into outside of the property tax? 

Additionally, I know Jersey City's revaluation in 2017 was incredibly difficult both to implement and politically painful, but it made property taxation in the city fairer. Are you open to mandating annual reassessments/revaluations to ensure the property tax remains as fair as it can?
*
How are you going to fix the housing crisis? I do not believe there should be a reality in where a roach infested studio should go for nearly 2k a month. Where are regular people making median income supposed to live?
*
Are you going to continue fully funding PERS?
*
I work as a contractor for a Data Center where I don't get paid for taking a vacation. As governor would you sign a bill to allow contract workers such as myself 1 week paid vacation? I was able to get paid sick time thanks to Murphy.
*
Are you ready to fight for us? The federal government is going to be very hostile toward ‘blue states’ for at least the next four years.
*
Idk if you could answer this but what are your thoughts on student loans and how difficult it is for repayment and forgiveness? Society thinks student loan holders are young men and women but the majority of loan owners are middle age or older who came from working class families who are still paying off.  To this day I'm still having issues with payments with loans that was generated when GW Bush was president. 
*
What are your goals for education and educators?
*
What are the policies and ideas you are bringing regarding lower rental costs as well as home costs. Rent is absolutely crushing to just be able to put a decent roof over my family's head. 

I won't ask about child care because that may be a mess depending what the president does with the Block Grant for Child Care (CCDBG).
*
How do you expect to compete with a corporate-backed, democratic machine-backed Josh Gottheimer who already has millions in his war chest? Seems like the deck is stacked against you and the other democratic candidates.
*
How do you see the current state of Hudson County Democrats? And how do you differ from the corrupt machine that is the Northeast NJ democratic party?
*
How would you right now approach this mysterious drone issue?
*
As mayor of Jersey City, you dealt with NYC’s Haredi community when they grew large enough to expand across the river, and some clashes that occurred. Can you explain how you walked the fine line of trying to guide diverse communities to find common ground? 

And what is a governor's role in balancing a sensitive issue like this on the local level, and making sure different communities have mutual understandings? Or is it a zero-sum game?

Thanks for doing this!

**EDIT**: grammar
*
What train routes would you explore creating by using existing rails?
*
As governor will you be able to tell us what the real deal is with these drones?
*
Good afternoon

I know you’ve got a reputation as pro-transit, especially by comparison to other candidates. I’ll keep it to a few specifics and a broad question

 What are your thoughts on the Glassboro Camden Line, and do you think you’d give consideration to modifying the plan to instead operate vehicles compatible with the existing PACTO line to provide direct access to Philadelphia?

 Electrification of transit, both for operational and environmental benefits, has been successful both historically, and in recent events Caltrain’s recent project. Some NJT routes like the Coast Line, are already partly electrified, needing diesels only for the last sections. Would you support extending the wires on more NJ transit lines?

On the bus front, how realistic would a general improvement in frequencies be on some local routes? Many run only once per hour and are of limited utility as a result, especially when trying to transfer to other transit lines.
*
Thanks for doing an AMA. Your policies on your campaign site are thorough and well thought out. 

But, we are due to swing back to a GOP governor.  What messaging are you using to grab nonpolitical, non-news consuming voters? How will you reach them and then what will you say? This includes nonvoting dems, moderates, and center leaning GOP.
*
If elected governor, you’re going to have to work with a lot of powerful machine politicians like Speaker Coughlin and Senator-Mayor Brian Stack who won’t be too pleased with the campaign you’re running. How will you get your agenda through the NJLeg when Democrats and Republicans alike will be trying to sabotage you?

Also, who will you endorse in the Jersey City mayoral race to ensure Jim McGreevey doesn’t get anywhere near power again?
*
US News ranks NJ as 43rd for Opportunity and 48th for fiscal stability. This is far below the education 4, healthcare 4 and crime 5th that you highlight in your policy plans. How do you plan to bring up our ranking in the much more needed categories.
*
What can we do to the NJ tax code to make NJ more attractive to both individual and businesses compared to NYS and CT?
*
What are your thoughts on giving handouts to large developers to build housing? Would the tax break percentage reflect the amount of affordable housing?
*
Driving in the state has become horrifying and dangerous. Just this morning on my 30-minute commute, a car drove through oncoming traffic to pass other cars turning and nearly caused a crash as he cut through into traffic. Then another car drove through the shoulder to make a left turn in front of people in the left lane. And then someone tried to cut me off on a merger and nearly drove me off the road. 
How can we decrease the traffic on the roads and make it safe to drive again? 

Our state isn't doing anything to develop housing for families with kids, and our administrators are passing tax incentives to keep elderly in their homes longer, further decreasing the supply of housing. Developers purchase every starter home that comes on the market to convert them into multi-million dollar mansions. 
What do you propose we can do to make New Jersey affordable for middle-class families again?
*
You're openly critical of "The Machine" and Jersey's political bosses - if you get the Democratic nomination, how will you unify Democrats across the state to ensure a Democrat wins in November?
*
It’s seems most housing development in Jersey City are apartment buildings. These disproportionately benefit developers and investors. Why have you not promoted development of single family homes in jersey city?
*
NJ Transit's continued issues over several administrations kind of indicate the problem is NJ Transit itself. How are you going to deal with the egos and institutional people at NJT who are seemingly causing the problems?
*
Why were you so upset about parking still being allowed on the street of your luxurious Rhode Island summer home?

*
Do you think Spadea should be off of 101.5?
*
Instead of asking about specific policies, please tell me WHY I should vote for you over someone else? Politicians will say anything to get your vote, but I want you to explain to me what you will bring that's different than the rest.
*
What is your opinion on the latest update to NJ's affordable housing mandate?  How do you plan to work to make housing more affordable for New Jersey's residents?
*
It's not important to anyone but this subreddit, but ...what's your usual breakfast sandwich order?
*
Steven! Mayor Fulop!! So far, you're my top candidate. 

I'm a 34yo teacher from Monmouth County. I worry about affordability, slow rise in wages for public servants, and the upcoming presidency of a possible authoritarian fascist. 

What will you do regarding the amount of state/public dollars going into private schools and busing to private schools using public funds? I'm thinking about all over the state - Lakewood, Jackson, Toms River specifically. A significant amount of state funding has been siphoned from these school districts into private schools, to the detriment of Lakewoods budgets - and this has been going on for decades. What can we do to resolve these issues so that EVERYONE in the state has access to the best FREE public education? 

I worry too about property taxes, cost of housing. I grew up in Long Branch, NJ. I cannot afford to rent a 1 bedroom apartment by myself in my own hometown, let alone dream of buying a condo for myself, anywhere in this great state. 

 What will you do to combat developer interests vs. the interest of people who live in these quickly gentrifying towns?
*
Fellow JP Stevens grad (06) and Jersey City resident (2012-2017)! If elected, what would you do to fix NJ Transit? Trains to and from the city are marred by delays, making it difficult for NJ residents to arrive to work on time or be home to spend time with their families.
*
Somebody needs to put some thought into the differences between ease of access, transportation, employment opportunities, living conditions and cost of living across the state. A major portion of Southern New Jersey, outside of shore towns is bordering destitute and majorly depressed. The average home price in Salem county is a third of the average cost of housing in Cape May and yet they share relative property tax averages. And this is a common theme across the state. Salem and Cumberland County held some of the highest suicide rates in the state as of the last few years and mental health overall is declining rapidly. And our government seems to be only concerned with life in the northwestern corner. Cumberland county is historically the most impoverished county in the state and it’s only getting worse. I know more adult people living off credit cards and filing for bankruptcy because of student loans and high cost of living than I ever thought possible. We have no trains, no convenient public transportation. Why does nobody seem to care about this? And why, when there is so little opportunity, do these counties pay almost just as much in property taxes as anywhere else? The average income in Cumberland is around $60k. HOUSEHOLD. That’s $30k average by person. The Lowest in the state. What are your views on this? Will you continue to ignore a major portion of your citizens like the rest of our governors have?
*
A couple of questions related to PATH: 

How will you work with the port authority to ensure they finally 1) expand service to Newark, and 2) increase off-peak and weekend frequencies? 

Who would be your ideal commissioner picks to help end the cronyism on the PANYNJ Board?
*
What are your thoughts on what will likely be your main opponent in the primaries, Mikie Sherrill?
*
You have done a great job in changing zoning to increase housing and transportation (pedestrian and bike infrastructure) in Jersey city. 

How will you get the state to pass Yimby/Strong Towns legislation (remove parking minimum requirements, ban/ change Euclid zoning, remove plot size minimums, implement up zoning/ infill, and reduce other red tape) to make it easier to build housing (of kinds: multiplexes, apartments, condos, homes, multi family, etc.)? how do you plan to fix the problems plaguing NJ Transit? Any interesting in developing a rapid transit system in North Jersey? What’s your opinion of NJ having a Rank choice/ Instant runoff voting system? Should political campaigns only be funded by public funds and ban private funds? Any plans to make it easier for people without college degrees to get jobs?
*
What is your plan to implement vision zero statewide? What carrots and what sticks can the governor use to get municipalities to make a greater investment in building complete streets that are safe for drivers, pedestrians, and bicyclists?
*
What are your plans on addressing the ongoing issue with our State Parks, Sites and Forests? It seems all the current administration cares about is Liberty State Park. The rest are left understaffed, poorly maintained, and with little to no enforcement. I've seen this first-hand having worked for the State Park Service for a few years. The last 3 administrations have done little to nothing for us. 

Neighboring NY and PA state parks and forests receive 6X and 3X the average funding a New Jersey state park receives.
*
Dou you think the service frequency of the PATH train outside of rush hour is acceptable?
*
If you become governor, will you push to ban regulated marijuana use for police officers?
*
Hello. Welcome to the New Jersey subreddit.  Other than your policies, what is your opinion as to why Jersey City has grown and developed so much in the last decade, and how do you think NJ could attract that level of growth and development in other cities and counties in NJ? 

If other cities in NJ were to grow at a similarly rapid rate that Jersey City has grown, how do you think that politicians in NJ would respond regarding transportation infrastructure in those areas? In your opinion, if other NJ areas start seeing rapid growth, would NJ political leaders be more likely to support more road infrastructure or more public transit infrastructure (trains, buses, PATH, etc.) in those fast growing areas?  Is there a threshold of population density (like people per square mile) that, if the threshold were crossed, that NJ political leaders would favor public transit infrastructure more so than road/personal vehicle infrastructure?
*
What are some of your positions regarding property tax increases and how to either bring them down or at the very least hault any possible increases until they can be properly "fixed"?

For instance, I'm in Green Brook. Last year, my taxes jumped about $1,000/year and this year they jumped almost $3k. We're now just over $16k/year. No home or property improvements and conversely, have had problems with many ash trees on our property, now requiring me to spend about $30k for all tree removal so they don't land on my house or surrounding homes. One tree landed on my woodshop/shed and it took 10 months to get it resolved with insurance.


Which brings me to my last question: If we are introduced to another invasive insect (such as the Ash Borer Beetle which decimated our Ash Trees), how proactive would your administration be in making sure they don't spread?

Thanks for your time.
*
Many things about our society/government functions need fixing, but none of it matters if we continue to damage our planet, leading to a reduction of resources and inevitable catastrophic consequences. What are some environmental policies you plan to implement?
*
Would you rather fight 1000 duck sized horses or 1 horse sized duck?
*
Myself and my peers (age 25-32) all make a decent living but most of us are locked out of the housing market in NJ partly due to Citadel, Blackrock etc borrowing at fed fund rates to buy up residential real estate and rent the properties. If Governor do you have any plan or want to combat this?  I know many people whose families have been in NJ for generations and have to move due to unaffordable housing. Housing here is always expensive relative to the rest of the country, but this is different. This is taking the power away from individuals to build their own wealth through home ownership, and is the biggest issue amongst my peers.
*
Hi,

I lived in Jersey City for several years while you were mayor. All-in-all I think you were a responsible mayor. 

What are your thoughts on funding government with other methods besides taxes. Such as renting public land or sovereign wealth funds?
*
Do you have any plans regarding development in Newark specifically ? Are you in favor of a Jersey City like trajectory or something else ?
*
If we need more warehouses, should we build them on land that has already been developed such as suburban office parks?  Should we aggressively try to save whatever is left of our farmland?
*
Pork roll or taylor ham?

Does central jersey exist?
*
You've been vocal against tax abatements for businesses and real estate developments in the state. Without these types of programs, how will NJ compete with similar tax abatement programs in neighboring states? How will NJ incentivize businesses to locate in a state as expensive and tough to do business in as NJ? Would you dismantle the film tax credit program that was critical in getting the Netflix studios in NJ?
*
What is your favorite thing about working with the legend that is Rich Boggiano? 

For me it would probably a toss up between his dashing good looks, and his cantankerous, Statler and Waldorf like opinions on just about everything, or the fiery passion for the city he raised his family in and loves so much. I’d probably go looks though.
*
Why aren’t you addressing the worsening quality of life issues in Jersey City? E-bikes dangerously riding on sidewalks, zero traffic enforcement, overflowing garbage cans, out of control BOE, dysfunctional 911 system, increase in crime just to name a few…all while you raised taxes on the middle class, drove out lifelong residents by making the city unaffordable, while giving tax breaks to millionaire developers.

How come you don’t give your own residents an opportunity to publicly ask you questions?
*
On the subject of NJTransit, would you be willing to increase the revenue transfer from the Turnpike Authoirty NJTransit to cover operations? 

Additionally, what capital expenditures would you make to invest in growing rail and bus service? What do you consider to be low-hanging fruit?
*
Please explain why you’re continuing to campaign despite polling in the single digits. Why do you think anyone would want a puppet, propped up by a handful of wealthy real estate developers, to run the state? 

You didn’t say a word about Amy DeGise. That doesn’t surprise anyone, but do you not see that your actions speak volumes about your willingness to play ball with the bosses. But please take the opportunity to explain that. 

You started an international incident with the polish government as the mayor. Why would anyone want a guy who picks ridiculous fights for his developer buddies to run something as large and complicated as the state of nj? 

What is your plan for transparency with your wife’s business dealings? Your attempt to help her buy a space to rent to a dispensary was an embarrassment to yourself and to the people of Jersey city.

Bertoli peddled access to your office. But that had nothing to do with you. Silverman was able to force their real estate projects into a public art program with a single phone call to your office. How has any of that changed?
*
How do feel that the gubernatorial race is likely going to competitive based on the results of the presidential election? What are you going to do for folks that either moved away from the Democratic party or folks who didn’t bother to show up to the polls?
*
What 2 steps will you take on day one to fix NJ Transit?
*
How are you going to fix the PATH and NJ Transit? Are you going to allow NJTransit to operate PATH? 
*
Do you envision your Transit-Oriented Development plan clashing with any local NIMBY opposition regarding dense housing around transit locations? Some townships/residents might not be as eager to build apartment buildings to provide those opportunities near their stations, which would hamper access to the transportation if those buildings were either pushed out of town centers / denied entirely.
*
Will lift the ban on casinos building elsewhere in New Jersey, not just restricted to Atlantic City?  If applied, would you allow for legal Poker rooms throughout the state of New Jersey?  If you will not allow legal poker rooms throughout the state, will you at least look into the algorithm of fair online poker and provide the results?
*
What’s up with the drones?
*
How will you support state agencies in meeting our clean energy goals?

As a 21-year-old I am scared that I will not be able to buy a home in the state I love in the near future, do you have any plans to help out potential first time home buyers and or control the housing market?

What are your thoughts on non market housing and would you consider investing in the transit village initiative? Also how would you support the creation of bus rapid transit system for the World Cup in 2026 and the extension of the Hudson/bergen light rail?
*
What’s with these Drones?
*
I was attacked by the Paterson Police in 2019, was never charged with any crime, but illegally had my guns seized by the State of NJ.  I was forced out of the state through an illegal arrest warrant for failure to appear at trial when I was never charged.  In October of this year, I was prevented from attending my mother's funeral because of this illegal warrant.  This was retaliation for exposing public corruption in Paterson in the course of my practice as an attorney.  What will you do to help me and ensure that these abuses of office, lawfare, and political retaliations will stop?
*
What is your position on Medical Marijuana pricing, and would you allow homegrow for patients?
*
You take pride in your record on Vision Zero and road safety. Could you explain why then after three terms under your leadership, Jersey City has a reputation for dangerous drivers who flout the law here and why enforcement remains so poor despite JC having one of the highest per capita police in the country? Furthermore, why did you run with an obstructionist like Boggiano on your slate who is so opposed to all traffic calming efforts by the community and opposes recommendations by your own staff? Why should we believe you’ll bring any meaningful change when streets outside of downtown JC remain so dangerous?
*
In light of NJ Democrats' lackluster performance in the 2024 presidential election, including in "stronghold" counties such as your home turf (Hudson County), what are your top priorities for restoring voters' trust in the party and in government as a force for good more generally?
*
Rep VanDrew just made a statement on Fox News that the drones should be shot out of the air, while framing the drones as being from Iran.^1 The last time a NJ Politician called for civilians to take things into their own hands, we ended up with Jan 6. 

How would you compel the House to censure VanDrew and keep New Jersey out of an international crisis initiated through badly informed domestic terrorism? As Governor, how would you compel the DoD to be more transparent in their actions over civilian airspace?

Note: I would really like to see answers around public transit and maintaining our neighborhood schools for K-5/6, but, it's just shit timing for this AMA. Hope you hold more AMAs

1. he closes the broadcast more clearly stating he *believes* they are from Iran, and recklessly states at the beginning of the broadcast that his secret sources say they are from Iran.

What is the plan to make NJ Transit affordable? I commute to Trenton and work for the state. The 15% fare increase and termination of the flex pass has made taking the train to work too expensive to justify. Now I am one of the many cars sitting in traffic on route 1 everyday. Shouldn't we incentive taking public transportation and make it affordable?
*
I'm a young guy in his 30s stuck living with relatives working a retail minimum wage job in south jersey. college isnt really an option due to massive student loans and credit card debt. appartment rents are out of control and nj transit is seriously neglected in this area that there job opportunities are extremely limited. as governor what can you do to address the lack of opportunity for people like me
*
As you have intimate experience with the PATH system, realistically what can you do to turn the PATH into a an actual real world class working transit system on par if not better than how the MTA is run? 
Specifically late night and weekend regular service with decent schedules instead of the terrible schedule it is now. And of course please get rid of the weekend Hoboken stopover for the 33-JSQ line.
*
Will you commit to better transparency around crime data and expanding and improving programs such as the AG's ARRIVE Together that would help reallocate funding for police back to the community?

Will you personally shoot down the drones?

How do you justify touting abolishing the county line system when you were openly supporting Tammy Murphy for the Senate primary?

New Jersey has long been a democratic stronghold. There appears to be a shift in the electorate. Voters want change. Why do you think it’s important that a democrat remains in the governor’s office? What have you learned from the 2024 election that will help you win the gubernatorial race?

What's going on with bayfront redevelopment project in Jersey City?

Nothing material has happened in over a year. I live in the area and a year ago it seemed they were amending the infrastructure with the constant heavy machinery but there's nothing else going on.

This seemed like a massive opportunity but there's no timeline out there and it seems, frankly, that it's just going to fall to the wayside and not go anywhere at this point.

Is there any prospective date for Phase 1 completion?
*
Up until Senator Kim successfully sued the County Clerks, New Jersey’s primary ballots were *wholly* unfair, giving County Party approved candidates preferential treatment on the ballot, while outsiders were placed in “ballot Siberia”. In addition to the fact that the process for County Party approval varies by county from “no process” to “open convention”, many of these County Party leaders — on both sides — are lobbyists and/or hold millions of dollars in contracts with municipal, county and state governments. 

This format was deemed unconstitutional by the court, and New Jersey had its first ***fair*** ballot election in June 2024. 

Rather than allow this sort of fairness we saw six months ago, as we speak, the Legislature is moving to restructure the ballot in an attempt to gain whatever competitive edge they can before they themselves run next June. This comes in the form of “brackets” for candidates and indicators on the ballot for incumbents, both of which are unabashedly disgraceful. 

Where do you stand on these matters? Should Party leaders be allowed to be employed by lobbying firms? Should lawmakers that support these bad actors, while changing to the ballot to suit themselves, pay a political price for doing so?

Are there plans to expand the "once a week" street cleaning that was implemented for Downtown to other neighbors of JC?

Hi Mr Mayor! 

1. If you are elected Governor, would you consider a Congestion Pricing plan in place on New Yorker's coming into NJ? As a resident of Jersey City, seeing so many NY license plates on our residential streets and parked in driveways (right on Montgomery, just look at the fleets of yellow cabs and black car services...) Consider also the number of visitors on our parkways during the summer? 

I'm all for the tourism, but it seems we've been playing second fiddle for far too long. Let's get NY'rs close up some of these budget shortfalls! 

2. What sort of ideas do you have for bringing additional industries to the state to reduce our reliance on pharmaceutical companies?

Dear Mr. Fulop, 

 Thank you for appearing here and answering questions. Your website is very informative and I agree with many of your educational points, however, I am extremely concerned about your ideas bussing students to new school districts. The idea of having a child on a bus for hours daily is not one I can support. I would understand consolidating a district with only an elementary or elementary/middle school into the district where it sends their students to high school. However, I cannot agree with making county wide school districts where students would be bussed for hours daily. In my own town, getting to the high school takes 15 minutes with no traffic, but if 287 backs up onto local roads then kids are on the bus for an hour. If you have more students on busses for longer distances daily, you are increasing the risk of bus accidents, injuries, and death. This would end up precluding students from after school elective activities and sports. It would create an undue burden on families driving and needing to pick students up from far away. I understand that where you are a Mayor, schools are close together and it is less burdensome to walk a few additional blocks. But if you want to be Governor, you need to account for the entire state. Your plan is extremely shortsighted for suburban and rural areas. I truly hope you reconsider your school re zoning plans. I do not know if you have ever had an hour or two hour daily commute. I have. It is soul sucking and there are studies that prove long daily commutes increase stress and decrease quality of life and hasten death. I know you want students to do better on standardized testing. I truly think all kids deserve quality education, but this plan is not a good way to help kids. You are only doing harm with this plan.

Can your office look into NJ E-ZPass regarding their obnoxious “administration fee” when one passes a toll without an E-ZPass account? Where is that money going and why does the NJ E-ZPass office in Newark have such horrific reviews?

Most of your first responders because they live outside the city cannot help elect a mayor but electing a governor is definitely something they can vote for.  How do you plan on leveraging that community so ensure they do vote for you?

Thank you for your service! 
*
What are your thoughts on homeowners moving out of their family home to move elsewhere but not sell the house and instead turn it into a rental property? 

And then the renters are unrelated people, who then rent to their friends? 

And then all of sudden, what is coded as a single family home becomes this business rental property with mattresses all over the rooms with 20 unrelated people in the home who pretend to be cousins and crowd the street with all their all cars and commercial vehicles-- commercial vehicles that should not be parked in a residential neighborhood, mind you.

And then more homeowners in your neighborhood do this practice? And then what once was a residential neighborhood for single family homes becomes this rental business? And then people wonder why Jersey is turning trashy?

Why is the single family neighborhood not respected? Why are so many unrelated people allowed to live in these homes like this? Why do we allow our neighborhood houses to become landlord/ tenant? This isn't an apartment complex. This isn't commercial real estate. Either buy a house and live it or don't buy a house. Stop turning a home into an apartment.

People turning their home into rental properties then in turn are raising the housing market, since now everyone wants to buy a home, cheaply renovate it a little, and then immediately move in tenants, and the owners themselves were never actually planning on living it.

These neighborhoods are meant to be for owners, not renters. 

Someone needs to fix this, please.
*
How's the weather in Narragansett?
*
Gunshots or Fireworks?
*
Thiiiiiiiis. All of this. A limited intrastate mass transit system is detrimental to New Jerseyans.
*
Yes this. The only way I can get from north Bergen county to Hoboken or JC is going through NYC
*
As somebody who works with the blind, this is SO needed. Especially in northwest jersey
*
Yes! I commute from the shore to Trenton. There is absolutely no other option other than driving everyday
*
Car enthusiasts hate on public transit and fail to realize that more transit = less traffic for those that opt to DRIVE. How are they not the loudest proponents for trains???
*
See, I.e. the train lines that used to run out of liberty state park in Jersey city where you are currently mayor and all over the state including down the coast.  How can we get train lines up and running in a similar fashion again?! The stops are still listed on the boards there and reading them and walking by is INFURIATING. How jealous I am of the transit system that once was!! Some even had meal service on board
*
Safe biking options would be great. There’s a ton of stuff within a five mile radius of me but trying to bike there is always frustrating and often dangerous.
*
I don’t know you, but it feels really nice to know someone else in this state feels the same way I do! Hope you have a great day!
*
Divert some of that $10B for additional turnpike lanes.
*
Yes plz
*
I second this question.
*
I support single payer but this is a loser at the state level, this something for the federal government
*
What steps could be taken to move us toward a public option
*
Chris Christie actually covered this pretty well by saying that it's something that he supports the idea of,  but can't make happen from the Governor's office. 
You can't forcibly merge towns,  they have to agree to do it themselves.
*
This, plus any thoughts on how you would do something like that for schools considering how powerful the teachers unions are in NJ?
*
Agreed
*
Towns have to agree on it. Sussex and Wantage explored the idea but the referendum failed primarily because Wantage’s taxes would be raised while Sussex borough’s would be lowered. I suspect this is the major reason why you don’t see more of this.
*
I mean Murphy tried a lot here, I'd like to see if Fulop has a different strategy.
*
I really would like a detailed reply to this
*
Corporations should not be allowed to own family homes.
*
Land value tax or a split tax to replace property taxes and freedom zoning would basically solve everything.. but I doubt any governor candidate would have the power or will to do either.

Even more unpopular would be to limit rent controlled housing and end old people property taxes rebates. I don’t think we should do either of those, but that would fix housing as well.
*
I just want to take transit to work but there's no usable transit for most of the state, and what is there is unreliable. There's no jobs available where there's transit, and no transit where there's jobs.
*
And maybe get a seat on the bus too while we're at it.
*
I second this question!
*
This!
*
Or if it's not possible to mandate, find incentives. Boroughitis is not good. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boroughitis
*
NJ has one of the highest malpractice insurances- it's why a lot of drs don't practice, and IF they do, they charge a lot of $$$. Curious to see what he has to say about this.
*
#DRONES
*
Seconding this because NJ hasn't had a party stay in power for 3 terms in decades.
*
That would require updates to the MLUL.
*
He is pro pro development and pro Mount Laurel.  I don't think he wants to stop developers at all.
*
NJ employers certainly want to have employees earning minimum wage!
*
This right here
*
He kissed their asses until they snubbed him. But don't be fooled, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree.
*
And rental only at that, not even many condos going up allowing people to own & the community stability that comes with that.
*
Seconded on the private vs public schooling. It sounds like this administration wants to move closer to more funds for private schools and less for public.
*
He won’t even direct and fund a JCPD traffic enforcement division to make JC streets safer. All talk no results.
*
Can we get literally any regulations on public marijuana use? I'm severely allergic and I've had asthma attacks from driving or walking through clouds of marijuana smoke. Also, many people smoke cigarettes and/or marijuana at bus stops, and I have seen (and suffered from) people vaping on nj transit buses.
*
given your flair, does that mean boroughs get to remain independent??
*
Central Jersey exists….
*
Is this Jim McGreevey’s burner account?
*
I just wanna go down the shore without being stuck in traffic all day and without going all the way up to Secaucus.

Not to mention everyone would love less cars on our highways. 

Maybe the drones we're seeing can be turned into public transit
*
My 2.5hr transit with multiple transfers to actual workplaces in NJ kills me when they're just 20min drives (I dont drive)
*
We need more funding for NJtransit to run better, we don't need more electric cars and gas guzzlers. It's causing havoc
*
I've love a loop for north and south Jersey so you could go between the lines when you need to.

I'd settle for a more complete bus system
*
Don't the rail lines up there terminate in Hoboken?

  
Defnitely feel the lack of options though.
*
Jersey City can't even get a bike line on a road just a few blocks from the Mayor's house

*
"just one more lane doc that'll fix it"
*
I can understand replacing the existing bridge with a marginally-larger one

I do not comprehend basically doubling bridge capacity for cars. 

If we're building 2 bridges over there, one of them should be linking the HBLR to the Newark Light Rail.
*
With a follow up if the answer is "No": Why not?
*
As we've seen that's not happening any time soon. Massachusetts passed single payer health care at the state level. Why can't NJ?
*
I think federal is too big—maybe regional is the way to go. Could NJ form a coalition with like minded states?
*
Don't disagree with this perspective.  
Would definitely prefer national single payer.
*
We already have the NJ Family Care/ NJ United. Let's keep moving.
*
If there’s a will there’s a way. Christie had some decent ideas but was just a lazy fat mess who became drunk on his own power. I actually work in govt
*
Perhaps the state could offer some kind of incentive.
*
Our school district just merged and everyone was for it.
*
You wouldn't be cutting teachers, you'd be cutting admin. If anything just take the reduced admin costs to cover increases for the lower earning teachers to make them commensurate with the higher earning district during the merge.
*
Unless we tax the value of the land or a split tax.. property taxes are a scam.
*
Easiest way to bring housing costs down is to build more houses out the wazoo; ones that are sold to people instead of Airbnb. Make supply meet or outpace demand.
I think it's either DFW or Houston that tackled this problem in recent years.
*
😂😂😂 (above his pay grade at the moment. )
*
someone just do something. i'm not talking NIMBY stuff like opposing housing. some do. but it's unacceptable when developers literally taunt residents at meetings who are upset that an Amazon warehouse is being constructed less than 300 feet from their door
*
Hey if the solution is paying everyone $35 an hour minimum, I'll support it. But you can't have a minimum wage of $15 and median home prices at $510K in the same state! 


The math ain't mathin'!
*
Merge the boroughs too
*
Actually, there are currently US companies creating drone taxies that will work from airports around NYC. Would be great if NJ would be an early adaptor and set up the infrastructure for them and reduce red tape.   

It’s also way easier, faster, environmentally friendlier, and cheaper than rail to set up. 
*
Even if you take the train to the shore today, you still have to carry all your bags, chairs, coolers, (kids?), etc. onto the train, and then once you get to the shore it's not exactly a short walk from the train station to the beach while you are transporting all this stuff.  I don't see that as being any more convenient than being stuck in traffic, which is why everyone drives.
*
Optimistic answer, nothing but political will. 

Pessimistic? The fact that 1/6th of the state economy is biomed
*
Is that true? If we’re I think I would have heard of it because that would a major political accomplishment
*
That's been my thought for a while. Get all the NE states and to group together and offer a single-payer option to compete with for profit insurance. Having tens of  million people or so to bargain with HMOs would be a huge advantage compared to a few million.

Also we the federal government already cover people over 65, which are by far the most expensive group of people with medicare and medicaid covers another 18.9% of people.

Not to mention 6 of the 10 healthiest states are in the North East so our costs per person should be less than states with much higher rates of things like obesity.
*
What can the governor do to nudge that along? 

Say we as a state demanded that South Hackensack and Hackensack regular merge.  How would you make that happen if they weren't on board with tht idea?  Let's not even say resistant to it, just that it isn't on their mind.
*
you gotta change the flair to merge the municipalities then!
*
Speak for yourself. One bag is all I have ever brought whenever I have gone anywhere down the shore.
*
ah I was wrong, it was a non binding ballot initiative that passed
*
Offer to increase state aid if they merge
*
My point is that is not common, especially for people with families.   Sit on the beach and look around...chairs, umbrellas, canopies, coolers are everywhere.  Very few people are traveling with 1 bag.  Imagine bringing all that stuff on the train with you.  That is why everyone drives.
*
