Title: Video compilation of routine night-time air traffic in NJ/NYC using powerful telephoto lens --hopefully to help believers and skeptics spare energy and quell frustrations as story grows
-
I posted a 10 minute video with about 15 clips of airplanes and planets in the night sky filmed with a powerful telephoto lens to the NJDrones subreddit.

The goal was that people can compare what they feel is a drone against routine air activity. The video has comparisons of what the same thing looks like when filmed with cell phone versus camera.

My apologies for another drone post. I am growing worried about mass hysteria growing and someone pointing a laser or flying a consumer drone towards a commercial aircraft.

Edit: I clicked shit post and dumbass thread flairs but they do not seem to be on display --only bread & milk.

I want to be probed!
