Title: Working injersey city today very foggy
-
I was in last night, and I take 14B to get on and off 78 to get to where I was, and usually the big ramp to take me to the tolls from Garfield Ave and Bayway (or maybe I just don't remember the names of the streets) gives me a perfect view of Downtown NYC's bright skyline, and I couldn't see a thing, it was just darkness.  Going over the Newark Bay Bridge was much of the same, halfway to the top, there was nothing behind me, and I couldn't even see the structure of the bridge in front of me, let alone of course the cranes at the port.  Something eerie about going over the bridge and seeing nothing.
