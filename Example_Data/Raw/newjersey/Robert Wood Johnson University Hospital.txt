Title: Robert Wood Johnson University Hospital
-
I would suggest you go to Hospital for Special Surgery in NY (there are satellite offices in NJ, too).  They are the number 1 hospital in the country for orthopedic surgery.  If you call the main number, they can connect you to someone who can take your info and help find the right surgeon for you to at least get a second opinion.  

I had one complicated surgery there, my mom had two surgeries there.  It is without a doubt the best place to have complicated surgeries like you're talking about.  

For my complicated surgery, I interviewed 5 or 6 different surgeons in NJ, then went to HSS and the difference was immediately obvious, which is why I chose them.
*
Not the same issue but RWJ did lifesaving surgery on my father who ended up needing open heart surgery last February. Afterwards we did have to kinda be on top of the nurses at times post op to make sure my dad was getting the attention he needed but iirc that‚Äôs common because of the nurse shortage.

Edit: double checked with a family member just now and this is also the place that removed a tumor that essentially wrapped around my cousin‚Äôs spine. He survived and even was able to walk after. YMMV because of course all surgeons are different but it gave my cousin‚Äôs spine another 15 years (he passed away from something other than his back issues and was able to walk post surgery‚Ä¶really a miracle case tbh)
*
It all depends on your surgeon but Robert wood is a teaching school and is very good.

Rwj hamilton or New brunswick and which surgeon did they recommend?
*
Would you maybe be better at the hospital of special surgeries? They have an extremely low infection rate.
*
RWJ in New Brunswick did 3 surgeries for family members in the past 18 months. I would recommend them.
*
I worked at RWJ New Brunswick for almost 10 years. It is a good hospital for different things. If I got shot I'd trust my care there. Podiatry I'm not too familiar with how well regarded their service is. But my experience dealing with them personally in the hospital has been nothing but positive.
*
I've had multiple surgeries at RWJ Bridgewater and Morristown Medical. I would recommend either even though I prefer Morristown Medical; it just feels more modern to me.

That said, I agree with /u/SmileFirstThenSpeak , et. al about seeing a specialist surgeon for something like this.

I don‚Äôt have any experience with that hospital, but I just want to say I am so sorry you are going thru this. If it‚Äôs okay I would like to share that my mother went through the same exact thing about 15 years ago. It happened from a knee break surgery gone horribly wrong , she ended up having multiple(20+) surgeries between skin grafts and debridings.  Her legs was severely damaged and she had atrophy to her foot, they called it foot drop, where it looked like she was wearing a high heel. 

However, due to nerve damage, she did not having any feeling from the knee down and opted to have her Achilles essentially clipped to place her foot back into position.  She taught herself to walk again after many doctors said she wouldn‚Äôt, she was very strong willed.  

Thank you for listening and I wish you luck on your journey here. Sending you positive thoughts, you are strong.

I went to RWJ in New Brunswick to give birth and had a fabulous time. I had kidney stone issues later and it was a severely traumatic experience with little follow up care. But every nurse I ever encountered there was amazing. I would say as long as your specific practice is adequately staffed with support staff (it was like one NP for 30 doctors in urology) you‚Äôll be fine but if not I would hard reccomend against it, they basically told me to use the ER for any follow up issues.
*
Don't recommend. I was in a car accident in 2020 and I still cant walk correctly. Billing was also a nightmare. Every surgery that I had there had to be revised to some degree. It depends on the Doctors but I went to Princeton Ortho to fix everything.
*
Rwj is my preferred hospital in the entire southern region of NJ.
*
No recommendations just want to say sorry you went through that. I have some health issues and I‚Äôm just learning that I need to be my own advocate! Best wishes!
*
After living by there and knowing people who have gone there, I don‚Äôt think I would go by choice to have a major procedure done at RWJ NB. Like many said here, check out HSS
*
I work in healthcare and also highly recommend HSS
*
Another vote for HSS. I had two ankle surgeries with Dr Scott Ellis. They are superior in my opinion.
*
The thing is that I don‚Äôt need an orthopedic surgeon for my amputation. Since it‚Äôs such a complicated and unique case a plastic surgeon would be my way to go. I met with 3 orthopedic surgeons and all told me to go to a plastic surgeon. 

Basically they have to amputate and reconstruct from the back of my calf where I have a good amount of soft tissue left and place it on the left side of my leg to avoid phantom leg symptoms and pinching the nerves bc I have 0% soft tissue there. It‚Äôs literally just bone and skin graft. 

But thank you! I am going to look into HSS. Hopefully they take my insurance. One more consult would certainly not hurt!
*
Wow, that is amazing. Thank you for sharing!
*
This is actually a good question, I didn‚Äôt realize there were two campuses. My review is for the New Brunswick branch.
*
What about RWJ Bridgewater?
*
New Brunswick. Dr. Jeremy Sinkin
*
Definitely going to look into it! I didn‚Äôt know a place like that existed! Thanks üòä
*
Thank you so much for sharing! I‚Äôm sorry to hear about your mom! I also have drop foot. And like 3 orthos I consulted with told me, if it was just that and not damaged skin and nerves they would be able to save my leg. But the constant chronic pain I have and very damaged leg they can‚Äôt do much. üòï
*
Thank you! 

I guess when I have my appointment with this surgeon I can check out if his department is adequately staffed. That‚Äôs a great tip!
*
They recommend New Brunswick
*
I am so sorry you are in so much pain!! 

I‚Äôll be honest, in retrospect it probably would have been better for her to have gone with the below the knee amputation, she was in and out of the hospital constantly and it really did wear her down unfortunately. So I just wanna say, as difficult as a decision to make, I think you are making the best decision and will have a much better quality of life. 

I also just noticed your Reddit name‚Ä¶I‚Äôm also mom to a Julian!! Great minds :)
*
Yeah! That‚Äôs what all the orthos and physical therapists I‚Äôve consulted with also told me. If I want a better quality of life, an amputation would be the way to go. It‚Äôs very scary and sad reality but I think I‚Äôll be much happier! Pain free and 100% mobile again! 

Awww, Julians are the best!
