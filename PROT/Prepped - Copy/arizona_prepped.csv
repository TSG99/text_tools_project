""do the fluconazole  it will take months of medication  watch for declining neuro symptoms  altered mood  gait stumbling  increased seizure activity etc   keep a log  if symptoms get worse then go to the vet  however if you really wanted to know if there are brain lesions then you could get a ct scan to confirm   "","arizona","west"

""my dog had seizures due to masses in his lungs  he lived for over a year with fluconazole  anti seizure medication and pain meds  the masses were found by x rays or else we wouldn't have known they were there  overall  he had a good quality of life  eventually  we opted to put him down after an extended cluster seizure   "","arizona","west"

""my golden also had valley fever reach her brain  she lived around four years after diagnosis  passing away at age 11  after a couple of years of medication  we stopped treatment  she did have numerous other health issues after treatment  though   "","arizona","west"
""a little on her story   she lost her appetite  which was very out of character  and had a slight cough  the valley fever test came back negative  but we were told it may be too early for the antibodies  not long afterward  she had six seizures overnight  it was so scary  ultimately  she tested positive for valley fever  we started the meds and she did good taking them for almost 2 years until she started refusing the medication  vet was ok stopping meds since her levels were very low  "","arizona","west"
""i m really sorry you re going through this  my 7 yo australian shepherd caught valley fever and she fought it for about 8 months  at first it was sneezing  1 month or so   then she got weak and really skinny  2 5 months   we had her on medicine and were regularly getting blood titer    tests done  she wasn t getting better or worse during that time so we still had hope  one day she started having seizures that turned into once every other week or so  she got more meds to help fight the seizures and they seemed to be working  and my last night with her my wife called me at work and said she was having seizures again and they were lasting about 2 4 minutes every couple hours  i gave her the biggest steak i could find on my way home   "","arizona","west"

""there's a pet neurologist out in east valley  i have a dog that has seizures and has had valley fever on two separate occasions  you can rule out it getting to the brain if they get an mri  pretty pricey and very helpful for peace of mind and knowing the best treatment path  seizures can just be inherent like in people  could be just bad luck  "","arizona","west"
""you might have fido's vitamin d levels tested   vitamin d has a great effect on inflammation and immune function  afaik  dogs need fairly high blood levels of 25 d  up around 200 ng  most commercial kibble feed will not provide enough d to get them there  adding a few thousand iu of plain old d3 can help   try around 1 000 iu for every 20 pounds of body weight  there's no indication that this will outright cure valley fever  but it may well help the dog to eventually beat back the disease  "","arizona","west"
""it looks like fungus in the brain is bad news  but not necessarily terminal   good luck to all  "","arizona","west"
""i have had two dogs with valley fever  on year two of treating my second dog  now   both were disseminated   the first in the skin as ulcers  and now my dogs is in her joints  the first was never fully successfully treated but lived to be around 17 and had vf his whole life   "","arizona","west"
""my current dog has been treated for 2 years  i have to change her meds every 6 months due to side effects but it is slowly decreasing in her system  she is now 7 5yo  "","arizona","west"
""that said  if it has reached the brain  the prognosis is very poor  i say give the fluconazole a try and manage any symptoms you can in the meantime  but know that it is very very challenging to treat it at that stage  and may not be successful  "","arizona","west"
""hugs to you my friend  they keep saying they're going to release a vaccine for pets  i hope that happens  "","arizona","west"
""as long as you keep on with fluconazole or itraconazole religiously and understand it can take up to 3 months to see any significant change i would say you can give it a good chance  we had a dog come in with vf that didn't allow the jaw to open and seizures  6 months on fluconazole she already showed good improvement  don't give up  have patience  recheck the titer when your vet recommends  never run out of medication so always call for refills when you have at least 1 week of meds left  "","arizona","west"
""sorry to hear about your pup's diagnosis  i fostered a dog with valley fever that had reached his brain  it made him blind and eventually led to severe aggression  it was a really stressful thing to go through  for both of us   and i did end up having to put him down   "","arizona","west"
""he was on a high dose of fluconazole  but i think we were just too late to help him  his original owners let him suffer with vf for 2 years untreated  "","arizona","west"

""my family had my brother's 4 year old golden retriever  we got him meds roughly the same pint in time as you did  the seizures became a permanent fixtures in our lives  oakley survived for 2 years before a grand mal seizure happened  it happened when no humans were home yet and so we don't know exactly what happened that took him  "","arizona","west"
""i don't say this to discourage you  dogs with seizure conditions can live a very long time if you have the ability to treat them like what they are   a disabled dog  "","arizona","west"
""i had a dog with valley fever  and this is exactly what i would recommend   i wouldn t spend the money for a ct scan  because i don t know how seeing if there are lesions would affect treatment options    "","arizona","west"
""treating the valley fever  and monitoring titer levels if you can  is the best course of action  your dog will most likely be fine after a long round of  treatment  "","arizona","west"
""i d rather have it given to me straight  it s very hard to find specific info on dogs that have seizures from it and potentially have it in their brain  hence my post    "","arizona","west"
""thank you for sharing your experience and advice  and i m so sorry for your tragic loss   "","arizona","west"
""our emergency vet we saw didn t imply anything about a decreased lifespan  but did say care for vf would be a long term deal for most pets  she also didn t prescribe for anything for the seizures  only fluconazole  and told me to follow up with a normal vet   "","arizona","west"

""not sure if that's helpful or what your dog is experiencing  "","arizona","west"
""honestly  i m not sure my vet expected my dog to pass so soon    3 months  after diagnosis  similar to your er vet experience  my vet didn t say anything about a shortened lifespan and prescribed fluconazole with the instruction that it would likely be lifelong medication   tg for compounding pharmacies  bc that stuff was    w out pet insurance   i sincerely hope your dog s experience is different than mine  but either way  it s good to be emotionally prepared that she may not make it long term  "","arizona","west"
