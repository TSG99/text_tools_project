""there's a difference between something ending up derivative and intentionally sourcing previous works with the purpose of being derivative  "","nevada","west"
""roasts are not about finding unique traits to poke at  it's about taking the traits that people know about and finding a unique way to poke at them  sourcing what other people have said about the target  is a failure from the onset  "","nevada","west"
""while it s true that roasts often focus on well known traits  sourcing previous commentary about a target doesn t necessarily equate to failure  comedy  including roasts  often thrives on shared context drawing from familiar material can make the humor more relatable  the skill lies not in avoiding known traits but in finding fresh and creative ways to present them  even if they stem from prior observations  intentionally sourcing previous works can serve as a foundation  allowing a comedian to build something unique and impactful rather than starting from scratch  "","nevada","west"
""in this case  it s a robot telling the joke  thats why it s kinda funny "","nevada","west"
""yes  it's about finding creative ways to present the joke about the trait  and that's just not possibly when the way you're getting there is by asking  what's a way to word this that's unmistakable from one that's already been done   which is what ai inherently does  "","nevada","west"
""ai physically can not take something as inspiration and then make something that  isn't  it  it can  only  take something as inspiration and make something that  is  it  by design  "","nevada","west"
""ai doesn t just copy things it takes ideas from many sources and mixes them together to create something new  much like people do  comedians often build on common ideas or jokes about shared traits  but they add their own twist to make it fresh  ai works the same way it doesn t just repeat what s already been said  it combines information in unique ways to produce something different  "","nevada","west"
""saying ai  can t  make something new isn t accurate  it uses inspiration just like humans do and can create results that feel fresh and original  even if they re based on familiar ideas  "","nevada","west"
""i'm sorry  bud  that's just not what it does  it doesn't take ideas or inspiration  it takes elements of works that apply to a preexisting idea or inspiration  "","nevada","west"
""and yeah  people draw on different ideas and spin them together  and sometimes they end up similar  it's like how various late night shows will often have similar punchlines to the same current topic  but like i said before  there's a difference between something ending up derivative and setting out to be derivative  ai physically cannot  add it's own twist to make it fresh  which is really the most crucial part of comedy  "","nevada","west"
""okay  i just asked chatgpt to roast your profile  and here s what it had to say  "","nevada","west"

""you really have no idea how ai works  and your telling us as much  "","nevada","west"
""ai usues nural networks that are based on the biological brain structure  that represent the nuron and synapse connections of the brain  these connections form to draw connections between multiple information 'nodes' and draws a conclusion to a question with that stored information  the 'learned information' or 'data set' is analgous to 'learning' or 'memory' and just as a human would come to an answer through past experience or knowlaged  so too does the ai with its 'data set'  the human brain has acsess to 2 5 petabytes of data while an ai could  if given full acsees to the internet  have 64 zetabytes of data  "","nevada","west"
""everything  yes everything ai comes up with is wholly unique and original  this is why there is no copywrite or plagerism claims for ai  its interprated works  however yes  it takes what we would call inspirtations from its data sets  thats what it knows to draw its unique answers from  the smaller the data set  the more alike the answrs will be to the original data set  "","nevada","west"
