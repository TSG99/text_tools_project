""it isn't that simple  we are are not allowed to just turn cattle out on the permit and leave them alone  there are strict guidelines and rules we have to follow or we risk losing the permit and them selling it to someone else  the biggest 2 things are having a range rider on the mountain every day  typically living in cow camps but not always  and following the grazing rotation  we receive maps that tell us how many days the cows can stay in a certain area and what dates they are in and out  the range rider has to keep the herd in those designated areas  these areas are fairly large and cattle move in herds so it's not unusual to move a few big herds and have some stragglers catch up a day or 2 later  and we don't tend to get an incredibly accurate count until it's time to bring the cows off the permit and home  so taking 1or 2 cows every day on a 1000 cow permit wouldn't necessarily be a noticeable amount until they are in the corrals and being counted  then everyone spends weeks looking for the missing cows on the entire permit  if no sign is found we then consider them dead  most likely killed by predator that drug them off and ate them or just old age  but again we are talking 10 15 not 100 to 200  "","colorado","west"
