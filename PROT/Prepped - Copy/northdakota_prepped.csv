""my first winter here was pretty brutal  however  i don't spend much time out in the elements  i rent  meaning i don't have to shovel much snow  so it's been manageable for me  my biggest advice is plan to spend a good chunk of money on good protective weather gear  good tires for your car  and an emergency kit in your vehicle  i have fwd on my suv  and i do okay with my winter tires   "","northdakota","midwest"

""we tried and tried to find a rental in fargo moorhead for over 2 years with no luck  almost entirely due to having a big family and just flat out lack of any vacancies bigger than a 2 bedroom  the grand forks area has a lot more options and vacancies for renting  and a lot less murders  but i m not sure about the market if you re looking to purchase   "","northdakota","midwest"
""as for jobs  if you just want to make decent money and live comfortably you ll have options  my husband and i  both make more in our positions here than what we would be in the fargo metro  but if you go to the really tiny towns that s probably not going to be the case  my husband and i both make  over  21 hr  both our workplaces have multiple job openings   and pay  750 for a 3 bed 1 bath  that s technically an apartment because it s part of a complex  but our place is a standalone building just like a normal house  in a perfectly average  not bougie but not shady area of town with absolutely everything within walking distance   "","northdakota","midwest"

""and i ll just back away slowly with my unpopular opinion that the summers are much more miserable than the winters here    winter is definitely more  difficult  but only because it s more work  yeah you re gonna have to shovel  and scrape your car windows if you park outside  and the roads get bad even impassable at times  but i would say it s just inconvenient and annoying as opposed to the intimidating earth shattering harshness people characterize it as  like it ll be cold  maybe probably   but unless you re in a situation where you lack proper housing and resources it s not as dramatic as everyone makes it out to be   "","northdakota","midwest"
""as many gripes as i might have with nd  i d say it s pretty chill here  look into places like grand forks  possibly bismarck  etc there s not many cities that can really call themselves cities that aren t the fargo metro but there is lots of opportunity to be had to be able to really establish a solid life in a halfway decent state  "","northdakota","midwest"
