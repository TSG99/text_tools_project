""i've been to a handful of renaissance festivals this year   "","louisiana","south"
""everything is going up in the price across the board  big ones like the texas renaissance festival  and smaller ones as well  it's more expensive for vendors to get around to places  it's more expensive for them to rent trucks and pay workers  everything for the vendors is increasing in price  it's more expensive for the actual grounds themselves with insurance prices going up and taxes in some states also going up  and again  the money they pay to their grounds team  the systems they use go up in price  and supplies they need  etc  it all trickles down as prices go up   "","louisiana","south"
""as for the attendance problems  i've never had an issue going  i buy early and go the weekend i reserved for  i've been going long enough i remember when it was buy at the gate and i remember days we got turned away because parking was full or the gate was sold out  buying online lets me avoid that and i appreciate that  "","louisiana","south"
""apparently they significantly reduced the number of tickets for admission this year  been buying tickets the day of for years  but they were sold out for the first time ever this year   "","louisiana","south"
""last year it was stupidly crowded  though  "","louisiana","south"
""for the most part  i think the prices are just the renaissance premium  i went to the texas renaissance festival near houston a few months ago  and the prices there for equivalent items to what larf has were about the same  same of the merchants go to multiple festivals in a year  so i assume they keep the price levels the same for all of them  "","louisiana","south"
""are you over it  lol "","louisiana","south"
""for me my only complaint is the merchandise  my friends all walk away every year with nothing but full stomachs  we watch the shows and dress up  we do the tastings too   "","louisiana","south"
""but the merchandise  oh god  it s just not that good  some stalls are handmade crafts with love  others are ai imagery or amazon temu resellers  it s aggravating  we go every year but buy nothing from the stalls   "","louisiana","south"
""we still love larf but yes  it really needs to expand  my group hung around after a tasting and spoke to the guy who runs those  and he said there are definitely plans in place to start really expanding and fixing things up  i hope so  cause wow   it s gotten very expensive in the last two years  "","louisiana","south"
""if you waited to get tickets till the last weekend of the season then yeah i'm sure you had a problem  i went the first weekend and bought my tickets just a week or two ahead of time   "","louisiana","south"
""i'll admit some of the booths  food and goods included  are certainly over priced  but there's also a ton you can get at a pretty low cost  you just aren't going to walk away with a sword or a suit of armor without dropping some cash  it's like disney world   "","louisiana","south"
""also  you can absolutely tip performers less than 10  shoot most of the shows will even have trinkets and such you can get for tips in the 1 5 dollar range  and some groups don't even do this for money  ordos procintus    "","louisiana","south"
""larf has problems  but if you know what you are doing its a really great experience  "","louisiana","south"
""side question  does anyone know how these things work  from what i remember  the structures here seem permanent  they are used like  once a year   do they lease it year round  do they own it  i know some vendors are local  but do the full time employees travel together like renaissance carnies  "","louisiana","south"
""larf is having growing pains  honestly  used to be nobody went  then the last few years it s been super crowded  everyone hates it being so crowded  so they limited tickets  and now it sells out   "","louisiana","south"
""but that s also kind of everywhere and every faire right now  trf is huge and still gets crowded  sherwood gets crowded  scarborough gets crowded  tickets sell out if they limit  at some point  us nerds won the culture war and now everybody likes our stuff  that s not a bad thing  but it does mean demand is higher and supply is limited   "","louisiana","south"
""i absolutely hate when it gets ridiculously crowded and the food lines get way too long  so i m actually happier with limiting tickets to keep crowds manageable  and hell  it means more people show up on sunday used to be some saturdays would be insane and sunday might be dead  so it paces out the crowd sizing and is more manageable   "","louisiana","south"
""and they have expanded steadily  which has been nice  i remember before secret bar existed  and now there s that whole back mini loop  if they re smart about how they re doing it this could mean our little local fair becomes a big boy like the fairs in texas  and i m here for it  but i d also like to see that expansion done smartly and with better amenities  like better paths and bathrooms  and not just more booths and stalls for vendors  hell  if i had my druthers there d be better vendor vetting and you wouldn t see a bunch of temu crap  but that s a problem in the industry in general right now  but popularity means expansion and expansion done right means a better faire for all of us  fingers crossed they get it right  "","louisiana","south"
""i get the frustration  though  time as was you could roll up to the gate and get tickets no problem  might be that way again when this wave recedes  might not  but i ll take having to plan out the weekend in advance over being packed to the gills  and that s the choice  me and my group already plan out our trip to trf months ahead with scheduling and getting everyone on the same page for camping  planning a weekend to run over to hammond is a whole lot easier   "","louisiana","south"
""now if the camping didn t suck  well  can t win them all  "","louisiana","south"
""i agree that some of the goods are priced highly  especially for some the quality   but the food felt par for the course as far as festival food prices go  i was prepared to drop some money at the shops  but ended up not even having enough time to see everything before the festival closed was unimpressed with some vendors' products  it was my first renaissance experience and i could have easily spent my whole weekend there if i had the time  "","louisiana","south"
""i've only been to that one once when i lived there and was very young  i reside in texas now  and their fair campground is just a swinger haven and safe space   †   all the fucking and sucking you can do with whoever's hubby  i don't condemn it   not my thing though  i'm just wondering if that's also a thing in louisiana or if its a renaissance fair thing in general  "","louisiana","south"
""i've always wanted to go to a ren but haven't  i was there last year but only to deliver turkey legs "","louisiana","south"
""i was really disappointed this year and last  last year we spent pretty much the entire day standing in line for food because it was so crowded  they seem to have made an attempt to fix the overcrowding issue  but the food this year was absolutely terrible  that's pretty much all i go for and it was a real let down  got general tso's chicken and it was literally oven popcorn chicken with gen tso bbq sauce   for 14   that's fine if i'm high at 2 am but not an event you already paid to get into "","louisiana","south"
""this thread is giving me horrible flashbacks of being in my 20s  living in hammond in the 2000s  walking into my favorite pizza joint every sunday night  tommy's  in parts of november and december and it reeking of jameson and bo from the rennies cutting loose after the weekend  "","louisiana","south"
""i went for the first time a couple weeks ago  i enjoyed it  compared to my ren faire back home  the louisiana one is a tad smaller  i was comfortable with the crowd size   "","louisiana","south"
""i d like to see the theming a little tighter  the food selection seems too weighted towards modern options  i m used to vendors and food sellers being at least a bit in character  one vendor was explaining that she left her credit card reader at home   i d also expect to see casual performers wandering around doing bits  but i didn t see anything outside the scheduled shows   "","louisiana","south"
""but those are nitpicks  overall  a pleasant experience  i really liked all the shows we saw  "","louisiana","south"
""yeah my wife and i haven t gone the last 5 years or so for similar reasons  not enough changes from year to year to justify it  most of the acts are exactly the same down to the jokes  choreography  etc  if you have a decent memory  you really aren t getting anything new out of the experience   "","louisiana","south"
""i like eating greasy crap and i only get alligator and other weird shit once a year at the fest  it s nice to experience some unique stuff every so often  but it looses its charm after the 5th time in a row or so  we plan on going maybe in a few years now that we have a kid and once they are old enough to understand what s going on  "","louisiana","south"
""we had no issue buying tickets the week before  we went on that massively busy saturday  and the food was standard price for festival event stadium fare  "","louisiana","south"
""also inflation affects everything  from cost of materials to cost of living   if you can t afford it anymore  join the club   we set a budget and chose more selectively what we wanted to spend it on this year  "","louisiana","south"
""yeah  it s probably expensive for families with a bunch of kids that have to have something   but if you just want to go in a costume  look around and eat a little festival food  you can do that too  "","louisiana","south"
""i dunno  just  some of us enjoy it   i look forward to it every year  ·     to each their own i suppose "","louisiana","south"
""bbring your own drinks and youll have a great time "","louisiana","south"
""everything eventually becomes a money grab which is especially sad in louisiana where we have so few events to get excited about or look forward to  "","louisiana","south"
""this year was so much better than last year when they had the foolish idea to sell unlimited tickets while also charging for parking  which then became an unregulated vehicular battle royale and it took 3 hours waiting in line in the car on the street just to get in  "","louisiana","south"
""they are definitely growing with that back row of shops by the woodland stage being entirely new  really nice to see compared to the couple of post covid years when half the structures where empty  "","louisiana","south"
""i think they should try to get a more variety of shows in  i felt like i saw most of the shows in one day  also  bristol renaissance fair near chicago has way more actors wandering around interacting with guests in character  it really adds to the experience and i would love to see that at larf  of course  bristol now costs something like  45 with mandatory  10 parking just to get in  so i guess it's also a  be careful what you wish for  situation "","louisiana","south"
""i haven't been in 6 years  got too big  not a bad thing for business   just not my cup of tea anymore  "","louisiana","south"
""i haven't been in about 10yrs  i heard that's it gotten really crowded   it was cool then  "","louisiana","south"
""we went last year  our first year in louisiana  it was pretty disappointing to us and felt like a satirical ren fest in a comedy movie  £ maybe we are just spoiled because the arizona ren fest is absolutely incredible and would be hard to compete with  i will say the larf had a nice setting with all of the trees and the pond  though  "","louisiana","south"
""they don t seem to have any issues with selling out and gaining traction year over year    sounds like staying home is a better option for you  "","louisiana","south"
""it seemed a little crazy this year with the tickets selling out a head of time  but i loved it just as much this year as i always have  been going most years since the early 2000 s "","louisiana","south"
""if i hear  me lady  one more mf time "","louisiana","south"
""then stop going  it's all just greed from the owners of the festival grounds  it's always been expensive but no they're not struggling for money  quite the opposite  maybe the actual fair staff that travels around need cash but i used to work security there  the people running the show are just filling their pockets  they get off on being at the fair  they don't care about the patrons  "","louisiana","south"
""did you go this year to larf  we were remarking on how they finally sorted out the parking nightmare  it felt so organized this year compared to years past  "","louisiana","south"
""it's really easy haha  i fill some potion flask with makers mark and hang em from my belt  "","louisiana","south"
""don't forget about edibles in the parking lot  "","louisiana","south"
""i still spent too much  but we did bring snacks and drinks just in case  but made sure to spend some money at the faire to support it of course "","louisiana","south"
""yeah we brought a wagon with drinks and other goodies to save on food costs  "","louisiana","south"
""went to trf this year too  it felt like the same prices it's had since 2015 to me at least "","louisiana","south"
""the reason behind the restricted ticket sales is simply parking  they don't have enough parking space to meet the demand  "","louisiana","south"
""i m glad they did if that s true  i had a much better time this year because it wasn t as crowded  "","louisiana","south"
""kinda  looking forward to checking out the acadiana one  "","louisiana","south"
""i will say  we buy our tickets the first chance we get  a couple months ahead  last year the parking was a nightmare  was hard to look at anything in a shop   "","louisiana","south"
""this year it was so so much better all around  and i hope they keep the tickets that way  sorry  but it does make for a better experience  hoping to do fantasy next year if they have it again  "","louisiana","south"
""i ve been there plenty  i got tickets for my preferred weekend as soon as they started selling  however  things kept coming up to push things back  adding to the stress  and cost  of switching dates and selling extras  whereas it was always simple to just go whenever i was able  i know i m not special but i got tix in person last year  on a popular weekend  on a beautiful day  and it was fine   seems like problems that weren t truly a big deal became real problems now   "","louisiana","south"
""the worst part is  who knows how many tickets went to waste due to this system    at least it still benefits larf  "","louisiana","south"
""every weekend should be a good weekend  "","louisiana","south"
""i went the first weekend and bought my tickets in the parking lot lol  wasn't hard "","louisiana","south"

""3 hours  that s crazy  i never heard of them charging you park before   "","louisiana","south"
""maybe it is because i went on sunday last year that my experience was so fun  and don t get me wrong  i got one of the last parking spaces and it was crowded but idk everything worked out kind of perfect  i m glad this year was better for some people   "","louisiana","south"
""mean "","louisiana","south"
""i mean enshittification and adoption aren't mutually exclusive lol look at literally anything else in our society    "","louisiana","south"

""god i remember last year it was impossible to even shop  clogged with people and majority weren't even shopping and just bsing  so i just didn't really buy anything and gave up  "","louisiana","south"
""i think you misunderstood what i meant  all i was saying is that if it's the very last weekend  everyone who had the fomo set in is going to go  while i understand the annoyance at the ticket cap  if there wasn't a limit to how many people could go in there would be significantly more problems  longer lines  too large of crowds  harder to maneuver  etc  which would be problematic because people in this thread are already complaining about those things  the ticket cap isn't there because they don't want your money  it's there because the fair can only reasonably accommodate so many people  they have expanded in recent years  introducing more allies for shops and such  but it's a careful balancing act between how many booths they can fill  how much space they can afford  and how many people they can let in  "","louisiana","south"
