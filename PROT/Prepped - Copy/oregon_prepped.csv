""while we have since tried to rebalance their impact  the very abrupt way logging laws were implemented in the 70's had a severe impact to the entire state economy but was especially dramatic in some communities   now  i am a big environmentalist  and these laws were generally overdue after oregon let logging corporations basically run the show in the prior two decades   i think that made it very easy for the general valley attitude to be  fuck the logging corportions   because  yeah  replacing old growths with poorly managed homogeneous fast growing pine  using ddt to reduce pests caused by said monoculture  and just generally being really shitty stewards of the land  they  the largest logging corps  did have it coming  "","oregon","west"

""i think  given the loss of population  the decrease in relative income  job opportunities  etc  it is pretty fair to feel that we did not do enough to help soften the impact and reinvest in either alternative industries or higher tech niches in the timber forestry industry  which  to be fair  we do a better job of now  though because many of the old lumber communities were skeletons of their old selves  engineered lumber jobs have gravitated north and west   "","oregon","west"
