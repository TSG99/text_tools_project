""that law is much less important than the hundreds of signs on the freeway that say  speed limit 70    "","utah","west"

""incorrect  the law states that the speed limit is the speed limit  if you can't pass while going the speed limit  the left lane just turns into another lane  "","utah","west"
""it's not impeding the flow of traffic if the traffic is moving at the speed limit  "","utah","west"

""exactly  it isn't a passing lane  it's a haul ass and if someone goes faster and catches up to you then move out of their way lane  pretty much anyway  "","utah","west"
""yes i'm there to follow the speed limit regardless of what lane i'm in  and if i intend to pass in the left lane going 70 then i'm following the laws  while you aren't  tailgating and speeding are both much more serious infringements of the law than  checks notes  going the goddamn speed limit  "","utah","west"
""i mean  you're not wrong  "","utah","west"
""intend to pass  but are you actually passing anyone going 70 in the left lane  pretty unlikely  "","utah","west"
"" i m here to follow the speed limit whatever lane i m in  "","utah","west"
""that s fine  please just follow the other relevant traffic law and move over to the right when someone is coming up behind you  "","utah","west"
""you are wrong  i asked a highway patrol officer about this in depth  long story short if you are in the fast lane even going the speed limit and people are having to pass you on the right  you are in the wrong and you get the ticket  he said if someone is going 120 in the left lane and you are going the speed limit in the left lane and they have to pass you on the right  you both get a ticket  you are breaking the law  "","utah","west"
""it's easier to get over yourself when you get out of the left lane too  "","utah","west"

""i do support not taxing social security since it really isn t traditional income  but this is even more money gone from our education budget that we could spend to really lift up our schools  in a couple of years  they ll have to start slashing the budget because they ve spent it all on tax cuts and vouchers  "","utah","west"

""we don t need a lottery  in fact it s the last thing we need  people less well off consider the lottery a chance to get a better life  but the reality is that the odds are so poor you might as well burn your money  all a lottery does is end up funding the public education system by revenue from lower income level citizens  regular proportionate income taxes are far fairer in equally distributing the cost of education across all income brackets  "","utah","west"
""frankly state lotteries are little more than an extension of a criminal enterprise into the public sector  the revenue it generates comes from somewhere and it s out of the pockets of individual citizens  it s a discriminatory form of indirect taxation and frankly an abhorrent con  "","utah","west"
""regular tax revenues provide a real return on investment by everybody at all income levels  the education of our children to keep this state thriving  there is no magic money tree  it s just a question of who foots the bill  "","utah","west"
""that's when they'll propose private firms can somehow magically do it for profit but cheaper   if only we give them the tax revenue  "","utah","west"
""destroying public education is the point  that was even publicly stated when vouchers was working it's way through the legislature  "","utah","west"
""we could've had tax cuts and more education funding if the lottery bill from the beginning of this year passed  "","utah","west"
""k 12 education funding is largely locked into growing by inflation and by income tax   "","utah","west"
"" higher education  is where this year's tax cut is likely to come from  house speaker schultz is very anti higher education  he cut it by about 1 5  last year and he was hoping for a 15  cut this year  but it's looking more like 5   he doesn't sound like he'll be satisfied after this year either  "","utah","west"
""a few years  it's already happening  each year my school has to see what teaching positions we have to cut  this year it was our piano and engineering classes  "","utah","west"
""the school safety bill is also not fully funded and  the new fee changes are a huge hit to district budgets  utah has a competitive economy precisely because we value education and higher education and if those things go away we have a serious problem  "","utah","west"
""best we can do is tax cuts for real estate developers and screeching about trans kids using the restroom  sorry  "","utah","west"
""keep the poor poor and stupid to keep the rich in their place  "","utah","west"
""the legislature would just cut education even further expecting a lottery to fund it  it s what many states do   "","utah","west"
""states with lotteries don t have these thriving school budgets  "","utah","west"
""no thanks  lotteries aren t the godsends people think they are and we don t need tax cuts  "","utah","west"
""why do you think they are going after higher ed this year  they need to cut the budget because they thought tax cuts to their rich buddies were a better idea  the thing that gets me  is even at high income levels  these tax cuts are only saving them a few thousand dollars a year and it isn't really a huge chunk of money  "","utah","west"
""what thriving school budget is that  we are in the bottom five in spending per pupil  "","utah","west"
"" states with lotteries don't have these thriving school budgets  "","utah","west"
""doesn't every state but utah have a lottery  or at least allow private ones  "","utah","west"
""why not  the estimated tax revenue would be tens of millions of dollars  "","utah","west"
""utah  nevada and alabama don t have lotteries  "","utah","west"
""lotteries are just another way for rich people to shove more of the tax burden onto poor and middle class people  rich people don t need to buy lotto tickets  and even if they wanted to  each one costs them a much smaller share of their income for an equal shot at the jackpot  but they get to entice people who dream of a windfall to tax themselves extra  and then cut taxes more for themselves because they successfully replaced the revenue "","utah","west"
""that s hardly anything considering they ve done over a billion dollars in tax cuts and that wouldn t really move the needle much  "","utah","west"
""so  46 of the 47 states with lotteries spend more per student than utah  "","utah","west"
""at first i was super surprised that nevada doesn't have a lottery  "","utah","west"
""but after 2 seconds of thinking about it  i was no longer surprised  "","utah","west"
""i feel like the tax revenue generated from gambling balances out the lack of lottery in nevada  gambling in nevada generated just about the same amount of tax revenue as the lottery did in pa last year  "","utah","west"
""nobody needs to buy lottery tickets  "","utah","west"
""growing up in new york  i knew rich and middle class people who bought tickets  as well as a lot of poor people that never bought tickets  "","utah","west"
""the lottery is smart people shifting their tax burden onto stupid people  the money can then be used to educate people so that hopefully less people will be dumb enough to play the lottery in the long run  "","utah","west"
""better than nothing  "","utah","west"
""utah is also one of the top states regarding student performance  money isn t everything   "","utah","west"
""we pay our teachers more than neighboring states   "","utah","west"
""per pupil spending is not the only metric  "","utah","west"
""  the money can then be used to educate people so that hopefully less people will be dumb enough to play the lottery in the long run  "","utah","west"
""so the long term goal of the lottery is to eliminate itself  guys what  we're already there  "","utah","west"
""and which  stupid people  paid a bigger share of their income to the state when their  100 in tickets don t hit  "","utah","west"
""the guy making  30k a year or the guy making  300k a year  "","utah","west"
""we're not  we're basically in the mid 20s  imagine where we would be if we decided to put the money into it   "","utah","west"
""editing to add  these rankings are also highly subjective and there's lots of variation  the funding for people is really the only objective metric "","utah","west"
""very true  which is why i'd be in favor of legalizing the lottery and cutting income taxes by whatever it brings in  "","utah","west"
""sadly there will always be stupid people in society  but i'd rather have them pay taxes than me  "","utah","west"
""depends on who the bigger idiot is  "","utah","west"
""if they each bought one ticket the 30k guy would have spent a larger   of his income  but the 300k guy might buy more tickets  "","utah","west"
""it's an interesting question of where the tax burden should lie  i see taxes as funding society  in that case i think the people that most benefit from society should be the ones finding it  regardless of their intelligence  "","utah","west"
""your approach sounds a bit sociopathic  comes across as  i'd prefer to take advantage of people that don't know better   "","utah","west"
""but the  30k guy has to spend more of his income to have an equal chance to win compared to the  300k guy  or conversely  the  300k guy has a much better chance of winning if they each spend the same percentage of their income  this is  in essence  what economists call a regressive tax "","utah","west"
""both men have the option of not buying any tickets  tens of millions of americans that live in states with legalized lotteries  aka almost everywhere  do this  it's not a regressive tax because nobody is forced to pay it  "","utah","west"
""that's the genius of it  nobody has to do it  but we know they will  which is why it always work  and why we get all that sweet revenue that we can use to offset cuts to the upper tax brackets  "","utah","west"
