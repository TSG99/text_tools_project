""kansas was also a hotbed of progressive socialist union pro labor movements  mostly due to the railroad  and also farmers'  uprisings  as well  obama did his big labor speech in osawatomie  kansas primarily due to the one teddy roosevelt did in the same town somewhat due to the john brown connection  "","kansas","midwest"
""on top of that  there was the big anti slavery push before the civil war  bleeding kansas  and then a bunch of former enslaved people  exodusters  moving en masse into the state as it was considered almost a haven  don't get me wrong  kansas was still very racist  but it was way  way less racist than most other states  "","kansas","midwest"

""since it doesn't sound like you are military or a college student  congratulations  you are a kansas resident  you need to update your license and vehicular registration to kansas within 90 days  so you might want to do this sooner rather than later since you're already behind  the good news is that once you've done that  you won't have to worry about your original question  "","kansas","midwest"
""you just need a ks license  you could buy one in colorado and then check it on the return flight  following tsa and airline guidelines for how to do so  it's not that hard   you would probably be falsifying a federal form if you did that since your colorado address would be out of date  listing a kansas address on the atf form but showing a colorado id at the store might raise some eyebrows  and is likely some form of illegal   "","kansas","midwest"
""just go get the license and do it right  i would say it's a little suspicious if you are thinking you need a firearm so desperately and quickly that you're looking to circumvent the laws  but i don't know your situation  "","kansas","midwest"
""kansas license is worth it anyway  if you get pulled over  it s going to be an issue  "","kansas","midwest"
""you are supposed to get a ks id within 90 days of establishing residency anyway  if you re going to be here 2 years you probably should just get one  "","kansas","midwest"
""i ve bought guns in oklahoma even though i live in ks  the address on my license just had to match what i put on the 4473 when filling it out  can t say 100  for co cause their laws may be different regarding that  "","kansas","midwest"
""if you buy it and bring it to ks you don't have any registration or anything like that to worry about   i don't know how the airline part of the equation works since i've never considered doing that   if it were me i'd buy it in ks and leave it in ks  "","kansas","midwest"
""when in doubt talk to the gun dealer ffl and explain the situation  "","kansas","midwest"
""however  one thing to remember is that colorado has magazine restrictions and kansas does not   depending on the handgun you might not get as large of a magazine with the gun as you would normally   if you plan to go back to colorado and have the larger magazine then you'd need to leave it at home   just beware of that  "","kansas","midwest"
""bonus tip   if you buy the gun from a private party you don't have to worry about the federal background check as long as the private party doesn't require it  "","kansas","midwest"
""i sold guns for 6 years at a retail store one thing we could use a bunch was  if you have a co license get a usps change of address or a kansas voter registration and that would be able to get you a handgun because the license being out of state verifies you are real and the change of address voter registration verifies you live in kansas "","kansas","midwest"
""whatever state you are buying it in  you need a id that's current with your address  so if you go fill out the 4473 and you live in kansas but your id is still colorado you are lying of a federal form  yes certain guns can be sold to out of staters but it can get real tricky  just forward some bills to your new address  get a kansas dl  much simpler  "","kansas","midwest"
""you will need a ks license  "","kansas","midwest"
""you're supposed to update your license when you move homie  by law  now i haven't always been the best at that  but i agree with the others and just get a license  if you want to avoid huge lines and wait times  look for a dmv outside the metro areas in a smaller town  i'm not gonna share where i go on reddit  but my typical spot i walked in and got a new license and walked out in 8 minutes  8 minutes of your time and probably like 30 dollars and this problem is nil  "","kansas","midwest"
""welcome back to kansas  you made the right choice moving here  è ª "","kansas","midwest"
""if your gonna to get a kansas id also having the kansas ccl is worth having just to avoid the long wait times on the nics system  and the license is only 32 and some change plus the cost of the class  i used to assist in the ccl classes and there is a healthy portion of the class that covers legal aspects of carrying a gun  "","kansas","midwest"
""i m going to colorado for the holiday  so didnt know if i should look into buying one while i m there  "","kansas","midwest"
""i ll likely just look into getting a ks license first  thanks "","kansas","midwest"

""guns aren't registered  "","kansas","midwest"
""as long as you know what the serial numbers are  they can be reported and possibly recovered and returned if stolen  "","kansas","midwest"
""i also have mine listed with serial numbers and pictures on an insurance policy  that policy also covers all my reloading equipment and accessories for everything as well  "","kansas","midwest"
""tell me where the gun registration office in kansas is   there isn't one  "","kansas","midwest"
""guns are like power tools in kansas   the only difference is that you need a federal instant background check to purchase from a dealer  "","kansas","midwest"
""hmm  okay  i'm so confused  there's no registration in oklahoma either  where i'm originally from   but my husband said one of the handguns we have is  in his brother's name  so we don't use it  his brother is in mt  so i figured getting it switched without him here was the issue  but if it isn't registered then wtf does he mean  "","kansas","midwest"
""his brother likely purchased it new  filled out the atf form 4473   one part of which states the firearm isn't being purchased for someone else not qualified  felons  under age  domestic violence  and you are the actual buyer  "","kansas","midwest"
""yeah it's highly misunderstood  federal law prohibits a searchable indexable list of gun owners  what people mistake as registration is just the background check form  form 4473  that they fill out when purchasing  the gunshop is required to retain the 4473 as a record of the sale  but it is never filed as a registration  "","kansas","midwest"

""el dorado is a college town that has a large variety of people  they also tend to have many kenyan runners and a diverse football team  i've lived in the area for a good chunk of time  lived in douglass  augusta  towanda  el dorado  and ended in andover   they all have perks  they all have negatives  i can't say how you'll be treated racially  as i'm white   my mother however is eastern european  and i've seen first hand  that despite her citizenship  her opinion doesn't matter  because she's not american  my advice would be  unless you are going to butler in el dorado or andover  just move to wichita   el dorado isn't terrible  likely better than anything listed other than andover   augusta doesn't have lots of economic push aside from locals commuting to work aircraft jobs   el dorado is a mixture  economically you have the refinery and all its sub contractors  and prison as top job contenders  you also have butler county community college as a center point   towanda is a mixing pot  people move there for a small town atmosphere  but many commute to el dorado or wichita for major jobs   douglass i don't remember  so i can't give advice as to it's strengths or weaknesses   "","kansas","midwest"
