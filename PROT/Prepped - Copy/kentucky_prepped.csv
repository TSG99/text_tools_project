""i grew up on a cattle farm in west central kentucky  and the i went to college in the area you squared  i worked for a man who had a cattle farm for a few years in that area   "","kentucky","south"
""the area you outlined is the appalachian plateau  and that area is highly serrated land  you could buy a couple hundred acres and you might not be able to get to part of it because the lowlands and the highlands are often separated by 100 to 200 ft cliffs  water and pasture land will be harder to find in the highlands for your cattle unless you're damming creeks before they flow off a waterfall to your lowlands  highlands are often forrested   "","kentucky","south"
