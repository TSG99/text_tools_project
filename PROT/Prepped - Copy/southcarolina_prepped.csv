""i genuinely share your concerns  but if we waited for a perfect system to come along to implement resources tools like these then we would never get them at all  options like these should be available in tandem with expanded reproductive rights  robust medical care  a healthier safety net  etc  but just because we lack some of those things or some of them need work  lots and lots of hard  uphill  arduous work  does not mean we shouldn't include these resources in the greater fight  "","southcarolina","south"
""there's also talk of limiting banning contraception for a double whammy  women are just walking incubators to these people  "","southcarolina","south"
""i mean   the thing is  for a baby  under 60 days old with guaranteed tpr adoption   the system works just fine  it's when you're older and had more of an established life of any sort beforehand that it really starts to suck  "","southcarolina","south"
""i'm not even saying these are necessarily bad  my primary concern is we're going to start seeing these more and the foster care system will get even more overloaded  fueling homelessness in teens and kids  i get that some people aren't in a position to abandon their child in a  safe  manner  what i don't like is this is they're going to tout these around as a  solution  to the whole motherly deaths and abortions paradox they've found themselves in  "","southcarolina","south"
""so what if they do  that doesn't stop the fight for bodily autonomy or reproductive rights  the alternative is not  well if we don't implement them then the system will heal itself and improve and then we can circle back to the issue   the alternative is then we don't have these resources at all and the really hardliner assholes who see pregnancy and child rearing as something to inflict on girls and women as punishment no matter what have one more victory  one more cruelty to gloat over  it's a bitter pill to swallow  but as women we've already got blood in our mouths from getting hit by these assholes  what's one more flavor added to the iron  "","southcarolina","south"
""i'm not saying we should ban them all together  i'm saying that the government is going to start implementing these far more and use it as an excuse to ignore protests for abortion rights  "","southcarolina","south"
""again  i'm not saying we need to get rid of these or that they're bad in of themselves  i'm saying the government is going to hide behind this shit as an excuse not to listen to demands  getting rid of them is not the solution  i'm just saying  outloud   they're gonna start implementing these more and they're gonna get overloaded and cause a separate crisis altogether   it was an observation and less of a call to action  "","southcarolina","south"
""and i am saying that they will behave like that regardless of if we have these boxes or not  i didn't think you were against them  but i'm definitely getting the vibe of  why bother if it's already bad   defeatism will not help anyone  especially this early  getting our rights back and improving things will be a long slog and may be beyond either my or your lifetime  but fight we will  fight we must  on multiple fronts  clearly we are on the same side here  just different facets of the diamond so to speak       "","southcarolina","south"
""you do understand that currently a woman can legally drop her baby off at a hospital  fire department or police station without getting into trouble  this is called daniel's law and it was put into place back in 2001 "","southcarolina","south"

""i have seen the founder of these safe haven baby boxes speak  these boxes are amazing and have saved lives  also 9 times out of 10 the foster families that get these newborns aren't your typical crappy foster families  they are people who are looking to adopt and these babies actually go to good homes   "","southcarolina","south"
""these boxes are not cheap i'm guessing the reason a lawmaker is trying to get something on the books has to do with state funding for these boxes  "","southcarolina","south"

""talk about wanting to be progressive and moving forward well abortion is extremely outdated and barbaric it's literally like the birth control of 1970s   "","southcarolina","south"
""but the safe haven boxes aren't about abortion  they are to give woman a truly anonymous way to safely drop their baby off  i would rather see a desperate woman put her baby in a safe haven box then in a dumpster or on the side of the road  "","southcarolina","south"
""okay  so i'm aware of all of that  i'm aware these boxes have existed for a long time and that their existence is not about abortion  "","southcarolina","south"
""my statement was not a call to action against these boxes  my statement was an observation about the state of the abortion debate period  legislators are going to push these boxes as a  solution  to abortion  they're already talking about bringing in the death penalty for women who get abortion  and they're already talking about contraception  this isn't about a narrative  it's about the actual  tangible  political reality of the situation  and the reality is  we're going to see way more of these boxes  the boxes themselves aren't bad  wonderful idea  the problem is the government body  managing the boxes   "","southcarolina","south"
""these safe haven boxes and abortion is like comparing apples to oranges  "","southcarolina","south"
""all these boxes do is provide a safe anonymous place to give up their baby   "","southcarolina","south"
