""consider why so many educators lean to the left  we've watched republicans politicians and otherwise denigrating educators as groomers  indoctrinatiors  etc  many of their policies at the state level are about forcing one type of curriculum that is often there intentionally make some students not feel welcome in their own communities  oklahoma is a good example of this  why would we vote republican  why would we support those who openly hate us and push cancelation mobs even if some of us do have conservative views on some subjects  it's a shame because some liberal policies have absolutely made education worse but that won't get recognized because the alternative wants to see our lives and students' lives worse off   "","washington","west"
""some educators do see activism as part of their calling  we feel responsible for our students and want to help them succeed and be safe  the 2016 2017 was a first year teacher in a different state at a school with a large immigrant population  some of which had parents who were undocumented  i remember after the election how terrified some of the students were  i had a student pop into my class the morning after asking for some paper  i asked him why and he said he wanted to make a maga hat because he was worried about what would happen if he didn't have one  this was a ruby red state   later that school year ice did start deportations including deporting the father of one of my hardest working students  keeping our students safe is part of our role as teachers  a lot of us see that as extending to keeping our students safe from a tyrannical government overreach "","washington","west"

""teachers are certainly entitled to their opinions on things  but any teacher that views it as their job to be an activist and push their ideology in the classroom  in any direction  is just wrong  that's not their job  their job is to teach people how to do math  how to read  how to analyze and interpret literature  understand the scientific method  etc  there will be times when politically adjacent subject matter is broached  and in those times the good teachers stay ideologically neutral  encourage critical thought  and handle issues with sensitivity towards all viewpoints  and in my experience  the teachers that are focused on those things aren't the ones putting on immigration seminars  "","washington","west"
""i hope you can understand that the  groomers  and  indoctrinators  stuff  while over the top  is a  chicken and egg  situation  not saying its right  but educators get labeled  groomers  because there  are  teachers that are talking about age inappropriate subject matter with young children and telling them to hide it from their parents  educators get called indoctrinators because there  are  teachers that spend their time advocating for their own political beliefs in the classroom and pushing it on students  i've witnessed it  again  i'm not saying the terms are appropriate or right  but the people using those terms are really just pushing back on the activist mindset from that subset of teachers  most people just want teachers to educate their kids and leave the political and ideological crap out of it  i think that's why so many parents have been pulling their kids out of public schools in recent years  and that's also why people push back on events like the one in edmonds  because most people can see through the marketing on that stuff and know it'll be much more than just  educating people on their rights   there's just not a lot of trust right now that teachers are going to handle a subject like that appropriately  "","washington","west"
