""when you try to maximize a project site  you run into all kinds of issues  you are only allowed to build to the zonings maximum lot coverages for example and these developers push right up to the edge  this not governed by act 250  doing so you trigger the need to manage stormwate from impervious areas  and if you are maximizing lot coverage  it becomes trickier to place the treatment areas  downsizing eliminates costs and efforts of engineering  if you are building and project that pushes the limits of the site  whether you have act 250 or not is not the problem  "","vermont","northeast"
""act 250 is a forever burden  once a lot has act 250  every change from building additions  increased impervious  use changes are subject to review  getting out from under the umbrella is a good thing if you can avoid it  but it's not the only problem with permitting this state has  like i said  regardless of act 250  you are still subject to wastewater  potentially water supply which is an entirely different permit  operational stormwater for new impervious  construction stormwater for disturbances  probably need wetlands screening  bat studies  etc   "","vermont","northeast"
