""you know all the new stuff we do  and the hot grab and go sandwiches  we re doing that on top of what we did before  most of our kitchens need an extra pair of hands minimum  some need two or three  there is an effort to address this at least in my area  "","florida","south"
""tenders  and basically all other boneless protein  get two hours before they are out of time  it s often easier if not the only play  to make tenders early in larger batches that last until the end of the two hour time when it s slow  so we have time to get ahead on other aspects  making mix and depending on the day backup mix  this also applies to wings and rotisserie    if we get ahead enough they we have time to make grab and go sandwiches and popcorn  and the kegs  "","florida","south"
""when it s busy you get the other end  where we need to hurry and make stuff  things that can happen due to this is tenders left in a basket after they finish cooking as we finish boxing wings  this makes them soggy and generally awful  we could forget to mix the tenders  this often means we need to drop them for an extra few minutes to make them fully cook as there are sometimes areas that don t fully cook if not stirred  and then there are tenders plain out made in a rushed manner causing single breaded tenders  or tenders dumped strait into the breading without being drained from the brine  "","florida","south"
""efforts are being made to fix this  but in many areas it s not reached  and in some of the more busy stores is too little too late  many delis have neglected providing kitchens the needed help and support  and many of the skilled cooks who made it work anyways left due to many factors including this  another is a lot of people are upset over the last few raises we got   "","florida","south"
""holiday season is going to make the problems worse  "","florida","south"
""as for my credibility and such  i m a fry cook in a publix deli  we re one of the more busy stores over all and typically most busy in our district  we have only just started to see the improvements  there are also things being tested to replace some of our customer facing offerings  some stores have replaced the hot case and stove top area with and extended tower and offering stuff prepackaged without the options you had before  "","florida","south"
""this could help as it would take a load off us  and free up staff to keep it running better  this could also make it worse as stuff in bags tend to get soggy if left for long  if the movement of product is fast enough though this could result in a return in quality overall  but it can go either way potentially even on a store by store basis  as i understand it this is just something being tested at a handful of locations right now  but depending on how it works out and decisions of management this could roll out to all locations in six or less years  "","florida","south"
