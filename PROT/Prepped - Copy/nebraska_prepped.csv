""my first piece of advice would be to ask around multiple online communities  not to say that our subreddit doesn't provide some valid criticisms of the state and specific parts of it  but it heavily skews toward people who do not like it here  and in some cases  don't even live here   which are useful perspectives of course  just be aware of it  "","nebraska","midwest"
""my two cents   i am not much of a city person so omaha and lincoln don't do much for me  but they seem like nice cities  they are going to be way smaller than what you're used to though  "","nebraska","midwest"
""as for the rest of the state   i wouldn't put too much stock in the comments talking about how it's full of racists or awful people  not that there aren't assholes  because you'll find those anywhere you go  and they may be a little more noticeable where there's simply fewer people to begin with  but by and large folks are friendly and welcoming  maybe shockingly so if you're not used to it  throughout  it obviously skews heavily republican which could be off putting to some  in my experience  you won't hear much about it and if you're not a very political person you likely won't even really notice  but it's a consideration at least  "","nebraska","midwest"
""what is true  if you're considering the small town life  is that small town folks tend to be change averse and skeptical of newcomers  whatever your background  that said  we're also a curious lot who will go out of our way to try to get to know you  if you make an effort to be a part of the community  almost no one is going to care if you're black or white  gay or straight  city or country  whatever  again  not to say there aren't assholes  just that there aren't that many of them  contrary to what you might find here  it ain't being  different  that'll run you askew in a more rural setting  it's being  distant   i'm as much a long haired hippie as you'll find and i get along swimmingly  but i do try pretty hard to be a friend to everyone and help them when i can  not much different than anywhere else really  just harder to go unnoticed is all  probably not as big a consideration in the city but i thought i'd mention it in case you were thinking about going a little more rural  it's not for everyone and it's fine if it's not for you  just don't let reddit scare you off  "","nebraska","midwest"

""you might not see this or even give it a second thought but as someone who's from ne  moved and lived around the country  and moved back  i can tell you ne isn't that different from any other state depending on the criteria you want to talk about and the specific area you are looking at  are you looking to stay in a city or move someplace more rural  if you are coming from a city and want to stay in a larger urban area  then you should ask specific questions about stuff you like and dislike there to see if people have similar experiences here  being single anywhere can be rough  do you have any hobbies or interests that could help people point you in the right direction  "","nebraska","midwest"

""i moved and eventually retired from urban illinois to rural nebraska  the cost of living is much lower  and with nebraska not counting my military pensions as income  the homestead exemption means zero property taxes   i like no income taxes or property taxes for my final years  though we paid out the butt for decades   i am in south central adams county   there is not a single taxi  bus stop  or uber in the county  and no bike trails  for a retired homebody couple  nebraska is great  winters have become very mild and shorter  summers longer and hotter  my drive needed plowed only four times last winter   climate change has also meant we are often on the verge of desertification  by the time any hurricanes reach us  it is a gentle rain   my village was founded in 1872 and has zero recorded tornados  "","nebraska","midwest"
""i came from colorado and  nebraska nice  is truly a thing  this state is full of warm and friendly people  especially in the smaller towns  people here are good to their neighbors  too  just this summer after a pretty gnarly windstorm my whole block was out helping each other clean up with zero hesitation  "","nebraska","midwest"
""hard rethink that  i wouldn t  "","nebraska","midwest"
""i see the comments about omaha and lincoln and things to do  i ve lived my entire life about 4 hours west of them  it s quieter  but still stuff to do  movies  bars  racing in the summer  street dances with live bands  hockey in kearney  hunting and fishing  nebraska may look flat by the interstate but drive north or south and you ll see canyons that are mini mountains  there is college football other than the huskers  they have sucked for a long time anyway  yes it s mostly a red state  but there are plenty of us more liberal open minded people that stay the hell away from church and all that junk  yes we have tornadoes sometimes but i ve seen one or two in 43 years  never destroyed my town yet  snow can be a pain if we have a nasty one  but it s not a guarantee each year  "","nebraska","midwest"
""i'm from the tri cities born and raised and i love nebraska but no matter which way you wish to look at it there is good and there's always bads no matter where you're at i feel overall in nebraska it's the safest for me and my family and true respect to the state there's good opportunity and it's good people here i truly believe there's a good core value with the people of nebraska and truly i find a lot of peace with how beautiful our state really is and people sadly miss some of the great things that we have such as the sandhills the wildlife a night sky you could clearly see the stars there's a true sense of peace you can find here that i don't believe a lot of other places have it's not just a flat piece of land there's just a lot more here than people would ever believe and if you are looking for that nebraska is a great place to call home and if you decide nebraska is that place i don't think you'll be disappointed  but then again it's all up to the individual on how they wanted to be hope you find what you're looking for in your journey of life best of luck  "","nebraska","midwest"
""why  "","nebraska","midwest"

""you can pretty much talk to anyone in neb unless they are stuckup people and they are weird   college kids kind of weird at times   but like locals are nice  lots of out of towers in both but you can kind of tell  lots of random outdoors stuff to do  can be boring at time  lots of bars if that's your thing  lots of good local restaurants  lots of people have familys   kids early so kind of think of that if you are single  easier if you are younger  "","nebraska","midwest"
""it's beautiful here   there is uber and lyft here at least in omaha and lincoln  but ya no subways or trains so it's nice having a car  i lived in astoria for two years but originally from omaha and moved back to limcoln for a job opportunity   it's  going to feel very slow paced here for you   but like everyone else said  people are a lot more friendly  cashiers  strangers shopping  sales associates   the seasons are a tad more extreme than nyc but the 4 seasons are desirable most of the year   do it  "","nebraska","midwest"
""i grew up in small town nebraska but left 40 years ago  i return quite often  since i moved away i ve probably made the trip back home from fl   al over 30 times  i have family and friend that live in different towns of all sizes  one of my sons lives in lincoln  it is my first choice if i was to return to live there  not simply because of him but because the city is a great one  it is one of the cleanest places that i ve been  the city leaders are keen on parks and exercise  since it s the capital and home to the huskers there is always a lot of activity  there is plenty of housing and reasonable prices  it s just a short drive to omaha that has anything that might not be available there  lincoln is surrounded by state parks  plus the cutest 11yo girl on the planet lives there  she calls me big poppa  "","nebraska","midwest"
""so as a person that travels frequently  "","nebraska","midwest"
""nebraska is a nice place to live but i would highly recommend omaha  lincoln or a suburb of either  public transportation sucks  bike ability sucks  a car is a must   "","nebraska","midwest"
""housing is pretty affordable  if looking to rent you may want to start looking now   the job market is decent  lots of things to do in the spring fall winter is kind of lonely depending on what type of activities you are into  if you like organized sports we have tons of college teams in the area football  volleyball  baseball  soccer and basketball  it s a short 2 5 hr drive to kansas city  where there are a ton of things to do  it s about a 7 5 8 hr drive to denver  the airport is getting an upgrade so having family friends fly in will get better  we recently legalized gambling and medical cannabis  it s a conservative stronghold from a statewide perspective but omaha and lincoln tend to be more liberal  we have a fabulous zoo and a decent museum  "","nebraska","midwest"
""depends on the type of community you are thinking of  the political machine in omaha is something else  they love to waste money on bs and not fix the roads instead  nebraska football is life around here and ladies' volleyball  college world series is cool if you're into baseball   twisty  feisty weather in the summer  cold  windy  snowy weather in winter with subzero temps   first snow hits the ground  and people forget how to drive  not that they're that great to begin with   high speed accidents and at least one car chase a week it seems    i live on n 30th and hear sirens  gun shots and the helicopter often  people here are a box of chocolates   some are cool  and others are karen and kevins on steroids  lots of bars and restaurants here so plenty to eat with good steakhouses  "","nebraska","midwest"

""i am a transplant to nebraska from the east coast     virginia beach  actually  i have been here for over 17 years and although i do miss certain things about the east coast  like the restaurants  history  culture  and the ocean  i can honestly say that moving here has rewarded me and my children's lives immensely  the cost of living and the wage potentials here are great  i live in lincoln  but also have lived in omaha for 4 years while here  the state is always hiring  and some of the wages are ridiculously high for the positions   Å "","nebraska","midwest"
""i've lived in virginia  new mexico  texas  north carolina  washington state  and hawaii  i can honestly say that the good life  overall  is here  the people are indeed friendly and there are many things to do  as a family  or single as an individual  as well  roads are pretty decent overall and you'll seldom see any real traffic jams like on the coasts  you'll be happy you moved here  if you do  i'm sure   "","nebraska","midwest"

""my husband and i moved to omaha from chicago suburbs  we ve been loving it  "","nebraska","midwest"
""come spend some time in the eastern part of the state  no one on here can tell you exactly how you ll like it except you  it s a different way of life compared to the coasts  the metro area is probably best bet  just remember we are nyc and will never be it  midwest nice is a thing just remember we don t all ride a wagon to school or live in sod houses  nebraska is full of subtleties  it won t smack you in the face with awe  there used to be a billboard that said we re only as boring as you are  "","nebraska","midwest"
""i ve lived in hot sunny places and cold snowy places  moved to here from syracuse  but never a place that could be both in the same day   "","nebraska","midwest"
""i ll be honest  after 10 years i can verify it s not for everyone  i would choose a place with more growth potential than nebraska  house prices are high for what they offer  it s hard to find places to rent before you decide where you want to settle  if you are living outside of omaha or lincoln you re seriously limiting job opportunities   "","nebraska","midwest"

""i moved there for 2 years  it was quite possibly the best 2 years of my life  mostly everyone is nice  a lot less traffic then where i came from  everything easily accessible  the only thing i didn't appreciate was the low wages and the excuse to it was  it's a cheaper cost of living  when in fact the only thing that is cheaper is the taxes  all other costs are the same  i wish i never moved away  "","nebraska","midwest"
""ive lived in denver  la  seattle  a small city in washington  a small city in tennessee and omaha  i would never live somewhere smaller than omaha again personally but it's pretty nice and super affordable compared to nyc and actually pretty much anywhere else i've lived  in the downtown part the culture is more similar to a big city  it's pretty wealthy as far as a small city is concerned but things like buying flights sucks because it's a small airport  idk it's a fine place to live and i love it most of the time and the traffic is minimal  but i miss big cities a lot  "","nebraska","midwest"
""the weather changes every 5 minutes and the drivers will make you wish you were back in nyc  atrocious at best  "","nebraska","midwest"
""there is bound to be a big culture shock for you moving to nebraska  even in our urban areas  there  are  fewer choices of activities  however my experience in the lincoln omaha region is that there is more going on than i usually have time to take advantage of  one of my particular interests is theater  between local community theaters  repertory theaters  the university theaters  and the larger traveling productions that come to omaha's orpheum and lincoln's lied theaters  i could see a different play almost every weekend of the year  "","nebraska","midwest"
""i have family in nyc and visit occasionally  so i know where you re coming from  i currently live in omaha  i moved here for work 6 years ago and would not recommend it  especially if you re single and looking to find connections with people  i ve lived in 3 other states and this place is by far the most difficult to meet people in  finding really anything to do here can be very difficult at times unless you are really into restaurants bars  not trying to talk poorly on omaha as i m sure some people love it here  but it s definitely not for everyone  please visit in the winter before you make a decision  "","nebraska","midwest"

""i lived in big cities all my life and omaha is like small town  but so far the only thing i think is really exceptional about nebraska is the hospital  nebraska medical center  i feel it's a really good hospital in a land of chain stores and parking lots  fyi i don't work there  i just feel it's real quality place in such a rural area  "","nebraska","midwest"
""went from socal to omaha for job reasons  omaha sells itself on being a foodie hub  you have to know where to go because restaurants seem to change hands a bit here and a favorite last year may lose its magic the next  omaha sprawls  cost of housing towards the city center ramps up and public transit isn't as well thought out or available as larger cities  the weather can be finicky  but it's not too bad  roads are constantly under construction  you'll get to know and recognize specific potholes like that pain in the arse family member that comes to visit because they're back every year for christmas  certain areas are real nice though   "","nebraska","midwest"
""all that being said  the aksarben  nebraska spelled backwards  area of omaha is pretty dang walkable and has nearly everything you need a short walk away  regular festivals and events in the park along with a farmers market for half the year  "","nebraska","midwest"

""one place i haven t seen people mention is nebraska city  honestly i wanted to move there after being in western nebraska for so long  it s such a beautiful town that s smaller but also about an hour or 30 minutes outside of omaha and lincoln so if you wanted some of the fun of city life still without the craziness that town is amazing  it s the home of arbor day too so it honestly has a lot on its on going on certain parts of the year  however  elsewhere can be pretty interesting  there are beauties to it and it can be  quieter   but as an lgbqtia  person living here i ve noticed it s more  old fashioned  values  but there is still a decent amount of support  especially the omaha lincoln area "","nebraska","midwest"
