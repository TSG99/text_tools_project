""there could be 10ft is snow "","idaho","west"
""goat lake is most likely a no go  hells roaring bench lakes are usually first to become accessible  occasionally you can acess imogene or alpine   it will heavily depend on snowpack this year  you should follow the sawtooth wilderness hiking and backpacking page on facebook closer to your dates and you'll get an idea of what's accessible  "","idaho","west"
""yeah goat lake doesn't even technically have a trail the last little bit and you have to scramble  not to mention you're going up into one is the coldest places in the usa  and sometimes on earth lol "","idaho","west"
""may   hike utah    idaho is a three way game of chicken between snowpack and smoke and fire in late july to september "","idaho","west"
""i've been in june and it was the coldest i've ever been camping  it was a terrible night of sleep  for sure prep for winter conditions at that altitude with mild warm days full of sun  and hope you don't get hit by a storm   "","idaho","west"
""check the forecast before the trailhead and call it off if things are potentially bad  that's the only important advice really  otherwise come prepared and don't go futher than you can get out of "","idaho","west"
""and yes you will be camping in or amongst snow  if that wasn't obvious its probably a bad choice go in august "","idaho","west"
""late may is prime avalanche season  in your average year  you're lucky if it's navigable by july 4 unless you've got skins on your skis  "","idaho","west"
""would definitely call the ranger station before you commit to anything  with all the fires this year  it's pretty hard to say what's going to be accessible next season  if they were anything like the alturas fire  things are going to be looking pretty depressing  "","idaho","west"
""i have had luck coming in from grandjean to tje nearest lakes there i think they are called trailer lakes  "","idaho","west"
""i have also taken the shuttle across redfish and camped near flatrock junction  at that time crossing redfish creek is almost impossible  "","idaho","west"
""likewise getting to goat lake iron creek may be impossible to cross  "","idaho","west"
""i've been there with feet of snow in early july  this is reckless  "","idaho","west"
""obviously not near stanley but hells canyon is beautiful that time of year  if you are looking for trails in idaho during may would be my recommendation  "","idaho","west"
""sounds like those lakes might not be in the cards for us this trip thru  any advise then on the best views in the area that can be accessed without 10 feet of snow  i'm willing to snowshoe but i'm not looking to be a hero  lol "","idaho","west"
""that is my stomping ground for the last 30 years  you may find roads still closed to get to any trailheads you were thinking of doing  you may need snowshoes in order to complete those hikes in may "","idaho","west"
""you should come at the end of june or the beginning of july  may is simply way too early for the sawtooths  "","idaho","west"
""that area burned this past summer  they're probably going to close it off to prevent erosion  it wouldn't be much to see with the burned pockets of forest  either  call the stanley ranger station  "","idaho","west"
""you might try hellroaring lake as one of the lower elevation lakes that thaws out a bit earlier    goat and sawtooth are likely to be frozen over and the trails several feet deep snow  "","idaho","west"
""not that it will be snow free by any means  but  none of the exposure you'd have while slogging over through the snow at alpine lake      "","idaho","west"
""just remembered camping off of fishhook trail may be possible  "","idaho","west"
""ok so my new plan is to go right to the ranger station in stanley and get some advise on shorter more accessible hikes for our weather conditions   now looking at hikes like titus or norton lakes  wish us luck   "","idaho","west"
""i d wait another few weeks if you can  it depends on the snowpack this year but even last year around 4th of july there was still some decent snow up around there and i think it wasn t a large snoe year  "","idaho","west"
""even ignoring snowpack  with the fires last year some of these areas might just be straight up closed  like the bench lakes  until they can get in and do assessments  that fb group will be a great resource  "","idaho","west"
