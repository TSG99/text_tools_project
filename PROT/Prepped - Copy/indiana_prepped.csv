""i do  or if there is something like a massive herd of deer i just passed or something in road  basically a  slow down and be careful  thing  but i really think it depends on the person how you take it  "","indiana","midwest"
""i do  and it was ruled as free speech by scotus  at least for now  "","indiana","midwest"
""i still do this   nobody does it to me which is fine  but i guess it s a carry over from a time long ago  i m in my mid 40 s so maybe it just isn t a thing anymore when half the population of drivers is now younger than me  "","indiana","midwest"

""i don't anymore  a woman driving 20 over the limit put me in the hospital a few years ago because she couldn't stop in time to avoid someone who braked in her lane  so she swerved into mine and hit me head on  if you drive like that you deserve to hit a speed trap lol "","indiana","midwest"
""i used to but with the way people drive since covid some people deserve to be pulled over ticketed  although i guess people who are so bad at driving probably have no clue what it means anyways  not flashing my brights has turned into my little way to fight back at shitty drivers on the road "","indiana","midwest"
""i grew up in texas and learned to drive there  i used to do this but have stopped since moving into the area  people have no clue what it is for anymore  so now i just tag the speed trap on waze or gmaps  "","indiana","midwest"
""why warn the minor criminals  let them pay the price "","indiana","midwest"
""last week i feel like a few people flashed me but it was subtle enough that i was doubting myself  like maybe they just bumped up and down and i thought i saw a flicker  because there was no hazard ahead  no speed trap  and i checked my headlights which were fine  i did have my cabin light on bc my kids like it so maybe people were warning me of that for some reason   "","indiana","midwest"
""i'll give a flash for hazards head like a crashed car or sofa on the highway  "","indiana","midwest"
""yes  i'm 35  "","indiana","midwest"
""no  i never did  because i assume the other person isn't going to know what i'm trying to communicate  "","indiana","midwest"
""yes we do  keep doing it  "","indiana","midwest"
""apps tend to yell you nowawdays  and it's kind of annoying the moment a car sees a cop or gets notified via flashes or the app  and decides to hit the breaks to go down 10 15 mph possibly below the speed limit  which is dangerous  "","indiana","midwest"
""by the time you see a cop he's already seen you anyway  just drive like a normal person  "","indiana","midwest"
""i do  "","indiana","midwest"
""i also flash my lights to let a person know it's ok to get in front of me  "","indiana","midwest"
""i do  "","indiana","midwest"
""i did that to be nice and a jeep bro gave me an x ray with 17 different led light bars so i'll never be extending that courtesy again  "","indiana","midwest"
""i had to pull over for 10 minutes to let the spots fade from my vision  "","indiana","midwest"
""i definitely do  "","indiana","midwest"
""my buddy got pulled over a few years back for doing that and apparently the cop said  what do you think you're paul revere   "","indiana","midwest"
""my car tells me when a speed trap is ahead   please don't flash your lights at me  "","indiana","midwest"
""i m also from south florida and do it too  but never see anyone else doing it  i m gonna put it in the dumb ways indiana people drive bag along with the lack of zipper merge  "","indiana","midwest"
""i just drive the speed limit and keep my eyes on the road   maybe focus on driving and not all this other crap that's going on in your head  "","indiana","midwest"
""i flash my brights for cops and deer  and use my hazards as a thank you if somebody lets me merge in traffic or anything like that  "","indiana","midwest"
""warning others of a speed trap requires actual consideration of other people  this is not common anymore  "","indiana","midwest"
""people are too busy with their head in their phones to notice  "","indiana","midwest"
""we don t call them speed traps anymore  nobody tricked you into speeding  you weren t trapped  you were busted  "","indiana","midwest"
""i flash my lights for road conditions or deer  "","indiana","midwest"
"" i want all the speeding and traffic weavers to get tickets so i would never flash my lights warning oncoming drivers  i m tired of these asses disregarding my safety with their reckless driving  they need to have an expensive ticket to give them incentive to slow down and stop playing grand theft auto on real highways  "","indiana","midwest"
""never even heard of this "","indiana","midwest"
""we still do in my area  i live in a small town and towns around me are farm communities  "","indiana","midwest"
""had to replace the whole front of my truck  it took the f3 tornado  and holy fuck the new lights blind me if i m standing in front of it i feel bad driving at night "","indiana","midwest"
""how many different reasons are there for flashing lights  "","indiana","midwest"
""get a radar detector  most local indiana cops and almost all isp drive around with ka band on  "","indiana","midwest"
""people don't get that as the point though if anything they don't take it as someone helping  if they even notice  "","indiana","midwest"
""use a gps app and it ll warn you  "","indiana","midwest"
""i don't  i mean  technically they can write you up for doing it  not that you are going to actually get caught  "","indiana","midwest"
""the better thing to do is use waze are your primary gps over google maps because it has real time reporting built into the app  you can police  crashes  traffic  hazards and other things right on the screen  "","indiana","midwest"
""then everyone who uses waze will get a notification as they near the area  this data also makes its way into google maps as google owns waze  but i don't know if it's instant like in waze and i don't think you can report via google maps  waze is better  "","indiana","midwest"
""of course if you have an older vehicle without a screen  you would need a passenger to do this for you  "","indiana","midwest"
""since it got tied up to gang activity i think we gave it up "","indiana","midwest"
""i don t flash my high beams   i turn my lights off and back on   i thought this was the norm  "","indiana","midwest"
""with new cars coming with led headlights that are as bright as a lithium fire i don't believe that it is a good idea to warm anymore  it was a nice jester to others but now that others drive like complete idiots  i'm all for them getting a 10  over ticket   "","indiana","midwest"
""and to the comment above about   wait till they flash you back cause they are not using their brights   one found out last night when they flashed me thinking i had mine on  you're lucky i quickly tapped them vs you holding them at me  "","indiana","midwest"
""seems like everyone is driving with their brights on these days  i m always flashing at cars  most of the time it s the new type headlights that are just brighter "","indiana","midwest"
""no bc i'm always scared they'll get road rage and start following me or smth  probably unrealistic but anyways "","indiana","midwest"
""i do "","indiana","midwest"
""i've literally not ever done this in almost 40yrs "","indiana","midwest"
""brights can be interpreted too many ways now  too many buttheads on the road  so i'll flip my lights off and on to signal if there is a speed trap deer road issue ahead  "","indiana","midwest"
""communicates without blinding them  "","indiana","midwest"
""i usually try to flash my fog lights  so it doesn t blind anyone  but the message comes across  "","indiana","midwest"
""nah  if you're speeding  you deserve to get caught  you're a menace  "","indiana","midwest"
""i think waze and apple maps have made this practice obsolete "","indiana","midwest"
""rarely see people pulled over anymore "","indiana","midwest"
""i still dp it "","indiana","midwest"
""someone just did this for me sunday so yeah  i slowed down and cop was in a good hiding spot  so yeah  "","indiana","midwest"
""i use apple maps to tell people "","indiana","midwest"
""i still do   one other thing i noticed was a number of passenger cars without running lights in the back but headlights on in front   some cars were hard to see driving up to them i have seen this more than a dozen times on the local highways   anyone else notice this   why do they do this  "","indiana","midwest"
""yes a real one did for me a couple weeks ago "","indiana","midwest"
""i do think it s a generational thing  33 here  and i don t flash my lights  i ll report a speed check on google apple maps though which is generally helpful at pointing them out for me at least "","indiana","midwest"
""i just use waze  "","indiana","midwest"
""nah  i just mark them in the apple maps app lol  speed trap warnings are the reason i always use the iphone navigation app even when i know where i m going  i very rarely see one that isn t marked in the app  and when i do i flag it  "","indiana","midwest"
""i still do it  it s a common courtesy  i also do it if it s dark and someone s lights are off  "","indiana","midwest"
""that etiquette needs to remain a standard  along with flashing your lights to signal another driver to go first when at a stop  or to warn them that they need to turn their lights on or brights off  "","indiana","midwest"
""yes  it's an age thing  most younger people have no idea what flashes mean  saf  "","indiana","midwest"
""i do it   don't see it as much anymore but did see someone doing it while driving through alabama   it was much appreciated   probably don't see it much anymore because i rarely ever see cops posted trying to catch speeders  like i really can t remember in recent years seeing a cop on xpressway looking for speeders   see it on interstate in other states more  "","indiana","midwest"
""with as many road rage incidents there are these days  i ain t flashing my lights at anyone unless it s to let a semi in front of me merge over "","indiana","midwest"
""i don't think know anyone under the age of 40 who does this  now people just think you're flashing them because you think their brights are on  so they just flash back and move on annoyed   "","indiana","midwest"
""not saying g you ger people don't do this  just that i don't know anyone "","indiana","midwest"
""several years ago  gangs in california used this as a signal for whom to attack  they drove at dusk or at night with their lights turned off and the first car to flash hi beams at them got shot or blasted with bullets  "","indiana","midwest"
""i was just thinking yesterday about how i never pass anyone i know anymore and see them rap the brakes in my rearview mirror  are my buddies and i the only ones who do this  like as an  i saw you too late  but i know it s you  hi   kind of deal  "","indiana","midwest"
""everyone drives with their high beams on so how can they  "","indiana","midwest"
""i do but it depends on what car i'm driving  one cat has auto brights and it's not so easy to just flash the brights   "","indiana","midwest"
""i think the urban legend about gang initiations on people who flash did a lot to dramatically get people to stop doing this in the 90's though  "","indiana","midwest"
""i used to warn other drivers but newer ones don't know what it means and i scared the absolute crap outta a poor little mexican lady once so i gave up unless it's a truck driver  "","indiana","midwest"
""where i'm from in the state  you flash lights to warn about deer near the road ahead  i rarely  if ever  see a speed trap  i guess cops don't care much about rural roads  "","indiana","midwest"
""i always drive with apple maps on and report them   i can t tell you how many times that s saved me as i drive a lot for work  "","indiana","midwest"
""i was born and raised in california    we were scared into not flashing our lights to other vehicles because there was a period where gangs would use light flashes for their initiation  i've subconsciously carried that with me and really only use my light flashing to tell the car in front of me to move  "","indiana","midwest"
""living in the south side of chicago taught me not to flash headlights or respond to them anymore  unfortunately  could be trouble trying to get your attention  "","indiana","midwest"
""yes  and thanks for being a bro  "","indiana","midwest"
""i always flash for potential hazards such as road pirates hiding  obstructions on road  headlamp issues  etc etc  "","indiana","midwest"
""agree it definitely seems to be becoming a lost art though "","indiana","midwest"
""i haven't heard of it here in indiana  here if i get flashed it means they think i have high beams on when  i don't  "","indiana","midwest"
""some know what it means and some don t  i did it today and realized we dont live in those simple times anymore  back in the day before internet times we all looked out for one another  ppl get mad if you flash your lights now  like bro  i m trying to help  "","indiana","midwest"
""not sure about indiana  but some states have laws against it  and you can actually be ticketed for it  they consider your warnings to be like an obstruction of their duties or some bs  "","indiana","midwest"
""we used to flash back when the world was sane    now it may trigger a random meth head into ungodly rage    "","indiana","midwest"
""problem though    with everyone and their granny rolling brights    it's hard to tell these days    "","indiana","midwest"
""the amount of people on this thread who are pissed off about new cars having such bright lights obviously don't understand that you don't have to look at them  it's not hard to look at the road line opposite the bright lights to not get blinded   "","indiana","midwest"
""obviously driving with your actual bright lights on is shitty  "","indiana","midwest"
""but bitching about head lights is a stupid as someone driving a sedan bitching about a truck behind them and the lights blinding them in the mirror reflection "","indiana","midwest"
""i do this and i'm 30 seen others so it as well  "","indiana","midwest"
""i still flash my lights and it passes me off to no end  when i pass several cars without a signal and come up on a cop running radar    "","indiana","midwest"
""fuck these inconsiderate asshole drivers  "","indiana","midwest"
""not my problem if you re speeding  besides  both waze and google maps show speed traps   google owns waze  "","indiana","midwest"
""tired of rampant dangerous speeding   let the cops catch a few  "","indiana","midwest"
""nope  what if that speeder was a wanted felon or trafficking something or someone  happens all the time   someone gets pulled over for simple traffic stop  find the car stolen and bam bad guy arrested  "","indiana","midwest"
""i do  every chance i get "","indiana","midwest"
""i always do  but i generally drive the interstate so it s not as helpful with so many lanes separating myself from the oncoming traffic "","indiana","midwest"
""i still do  "","indiana","midwest"
""i do every single time if theres cops or wildlife "","indiana","midwest"
""i do  but i live in a pretty small town  so i don't have to very often  around here  everyone knows where the cops sit  i've had people flash to warn me  too  i mostly warn people if  when i'm going to a bigger area  lebanon  indy  martinsville  bloomington  "","indiana","midwest"
""i do "","indiana","midwest"
""i flash my brights at everyone with those twin sun led headlights  i know they aren t going to have them replaced  but it makes me feel good that they get a taste of what i see as they approach  "","indiana","midwest"
""i do  truckers without speed control and older people like me appreciate it "","indiana","midwest"
""somebody flashed their lights two weeks ago and saved me and the guy in front of me from a well hidden cop  this was in johnson county "","indiana","midwest"
""i just did it last weekend on in32 to warn oncoming traffic that westfield police were crouched behind some trees near jolietville  freedom of speech  baby  "","indiana","midwest"
""rumor has it  it s against the law  i may be wrong but seems like i m right  "","indiana","midwest"
""there s an urban myth in the indy area about gang initiations and flashing lights that keeps some people from flashing lights   the basic story is  gangs ride around without lights and then the initiate has to go off the first car that flashes them  "","indiana","midwest"
""i do  "","indiana","midwest"
""i flash  i think cops know too cuz he says did i see you flashing your brights  i lied and said no i bumped it changing buttons     isp said it  wasn't a local nor county guy  "","indiana","midwest"
""a few years ago there were stories about gangs that drove around and if anyone flashed them they would turn around  chase the prison down and then kill them   "","indiana","midwest"
""i do not know if the stories were true or not  but i stopped flashing lights then  "","indiana","midwest"
""nope cuz fuck you  "","indiana","midwest"
""i tell them to slow down from the sidewalk so they speed up and get caught   "","indiana","midwest"
""oh the greatest is when you flash someone for having brights on and then they really turn their brights on to show you that those are just their regular headlights    assholes have to realize they're blinding ppl "","indiana","midwest"
""driving a car low to the ground is the worst   i have a tendency to get migraines sometimes from these lights  "","indiana","midwest"
""seriously  either people are putting way too much faith in the auto dimmer setting or they just don't give a shit "","indiana","midwest"
""it's just halogen headlights i'd be willing to bet "","indiana","midwest"
""this is a really silly comment   "","indiana","midwest"

""i also flash for the deer  they re everywhere  "","indiana","midwest"
""where i m from a flash typically means elk  goats  or cops  basically it just means slow down and watch out  even people out there seem to be losing the warning flash though for some reason  "","indiana","midwest"
""i had heard that  "","indiana","midwest"
""yah but you may need to remind officers of that   politely  and expect a ticket and then need to fight it later not at the side of the road  "","indiana","midwest"
""yeah  same  i'm over 40  still do it  i think most younger people make a speed trap report on waze or google maps  "","indiana","midwest"
""samesies  it was actually exciting back in the day when my dad would do it "","indiana","midwest"
""i like to quickly flick my lights off and on a few times  it feels more obvious  "","indiana","midwest"
""one time i had my lights off and a pedestrian signaled me by throwing both hands up and making a closed fist open fist closed fist open fist a few times  kind of like how a baby says  gimme  something  lol at first i was like wtf  and then i realized he was just being a bro  "","indiana","midwest"
""i'll never forget that guy  "","indiana","midwest"
""really  i see people with no lights on at least one a week "","indiana","midwest"
""oh  it does  not all are automatic and some automatic features can be disabled  i can't tell you how often i see people who think their daytime runners  which are a bit dimmer  are their headlights  but from behind they're practically invisible unless they're breaking  "","indiana","midwest"
""i was taught to flash brights for cops and off on for lights off   which i still see a surprising amount of the time considering the technology "","indiana","midwest"
""until the service tech doing maintenance turns them off to not get lights in the face and you forget to check and they re not on   noticeable in country driving but sometimes the city streets are pretty well light at night  "","indiana","midwest"
""i know of a couple people who despise leaving their headlights in the auto on mode  one of them said they hated it because their headlights keep coming on when going under bridges and the other just doesn't not having control of when the lights turn on or not  i still think they are crazy but they can do whatever they want  "","indiana","midwest"
""not all vechicles on the road have some sort of auto turn on lights    i see a lot of cars without lights on when everyone has their lighs on  "","indiana","midwest"

""i do this and it still regularly happens in bloomington  i don't think anyone ever understands when i do it though  "","indiana","midwest"
""they clearly need to add this to the driving exam  it's certainly more useful than knowing the maximum weight a semi can bear  "","indiana","midwest"
