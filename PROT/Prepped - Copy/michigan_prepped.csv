""it seems to me that restaurant owners who pay fair wages will not be harmed by phasing out the practice of tipping  please tell me if my reasoning is faulty  "","michigan","midwest"
""here is the  michigan minimum wage rate 2025 increase schedule  https   www michigan gov leo news 2024 10 01 michigan minimum wage rate 2025 increase schedule   which the proposed bill would change   the schedule indicates that tips will be mostly phased out over the next few years  so that in 2028 the minimum wage will be    15 hr  with tipped workers making a minimum wage of    12 hr   minimum tips of    3  with employers making up the difference if they don't make the minimum tips   so the schedule both increases wages overall and increases wage income relative to tip income for tipped workers  "","michigan","midwest"
""setting aside the effects of an overall increase in the minimum wage  restaurant industry lobbyists are complaining that the scheduled phaseout of tipping will harm their industry  but why should it  it seems to me that restaurants could simply raise their prices and patrons could lower their tips  and  in principle  everybody could come out about the same  again  i'm just looking at tipping in particular  not the cost of higher wages generally   "","michigan","midwest"
""that is  everybody  who has been paying their fair share  will come out about the same  but not everybody has been paying their fair share  some skinflint patrons stiff their servers  but restaurant owners get the full menu price of the meal even if a skinflint doesn't tip  so if restaurant owners raise meal prices to cover higher wages  some skinflints may buy fewer meals  also  some restaurant owners skim tips  but these are not legitimate practices  and thus are not legitimate objections to the proposed changes  "","michigan","midwest"

""i don t mind tipping for service especially when the servers wages are lower  if they raise the wages  then i feel like i shouldn t have to tip as much if at all   "","michigan","midwest"
""and if it s changed in an instant in one specific day  then i feel like we could all cut our tips way down all at once  but if it s phased in over time  i guess i m supposed to phase down my tips  ugh  i think that s harder to do and we will all just end up tipping the same and the meal will cost more  so i ll probably eat out less  which is a shame  "","michigan","midwest"
""tiping should no longer be a thing that people rely on to live  i always tip well but think businesses take advantage of tipped workers too much to trust them to pay people fairly  "","michigan","midwest"

""its keeping the tip credit while bumping tipped min up to 15 along with everyone else   "","michigan","midwest"
""what this means is the resturant owner will still have to pay 15 the same way they do the current minimum wage  ie only if the employee does not get enough tips per hour to hit 15   "","michigan","midwest"
""so basically  completely gutting that part of the proposal we all passed  democrats are capitulating to republicans here pleading poverty   "","michigan","midwest"
""in the end all the owners are gonna go  we need to raise rates because minimum went up  while their severs are according to all them on here  already making more  then we will be required to tip ontop of those new rates  so its a nice payraise for the servers  and a nice pay raise for the owners with 0 benefit to anyone going to the resturant  "","michigan","midwest"
"" it seems to me that restaurant owners who pay fair wages will not be harmed by phasing out the practice of tipping  "","michigan","midwest"
