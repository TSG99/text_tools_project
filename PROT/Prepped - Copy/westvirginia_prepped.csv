""best thing to do is go test drive one but dollars to donuts says it's fine  i drive a hybrid sorento  my parents have a hybrid rav4  and my wife has owned several prius'  none of those cars  struggle  in any normal driving scenario compared to full gasoline cars  the only difference is that they use less gas  overall  doing the job   "","westvirginia","south"
""your post suggests a slight misunderstanding on how hybrids work  also   no hybrid vehicle is using it's battery to go up a steep grade   that's entirely gas engine work  hybrid batteries don't really  drain  under normal use  either  they go up and down in level  but they cars are designed such that the gas engine is complementing the battery drive most of the time and the battery is almost always recharging in some way   "","westvirginia","south"
""the only thing i notice about the crv is that it has a slightly smaller gas engine than some of it's competitors  the rav has a 2 5 vs the crv's 2 0 and think those cars are pretty directly comparable  my kia also has a 2 5 but it's a bigger vehicle overall  like i said  probably best to test drive it if you want a good answer  "","westvirginia","south"
""so i have a toyota corolla hybrid  which i'm sure is much lighter than a honda crv and therefore maybe a much different experience  "","westvirginia","south"
""i heard all the stuff about poor performance and came to the conclusion   poor performance compared to what  a diesel truck  a mustang  yeah you're gonna get better performance up the steep part of 68 in a gas guzzler  but my performance compared to a gas only toyota car seems pretty well identical  "","westvirginia","south"
""keep in mind that the engine also charges the hybrid battery  not just drifting and braking  so the battery rarely if ever makes it all the way down to 0  because even uphill the battery is being charged  most of the time it's gas battery uphill and battery charge downhill  averages out to 48 50mpg  "","westvirginia","south"
""haven't been driving it for long but i've  never  even struggled to reach highway speeds  i've had it up to 90  have to try on the pa turnpike to try for more  but that's just testing to see what it'll do  your normal highway speeds of 70 80 present absolutely no problem  "","westvirginia","south"
